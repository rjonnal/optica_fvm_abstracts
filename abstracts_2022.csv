1,1,1,1,"Award Lecture","2022 Boynton Award Lecture: Untangling visual processing and sensitivity regulation using data from normals and from patients missing key molecules required for normal visual function",Stockman,Andrew,"UCL Institute of Ophthalmology","An important way of characterizing normal and abnormal visual processing is to measure sensitivity to flicker. We can account for over 70 years of normal flicker-sensitivity measurements with a simple, physiologically relevant sequential model built from a cascade of low-pass filters that requires only two intensity-dependent model parameters: one that adjusts response speed, and the other that adjusts the overall gain at higher light intensities.

We have also applied this model to 20 years of flicker-sensitivity measurements obtained from groups of patients with molecularly characterised deficits that affect different stages of visual processing. We can characterise the resulting visual losses (or gains) in terms of changes that speed up the responses of one or more stages, or slow them down, or interpose additional stages. Remarkably, we find that other stages make compensatory adjustments to offset the abnormality and thus help to keep the overall system in a useful operating range. For example, if the abnormal stage slows down the visual response, another stage is likely to speed up or attenuate the response to rebalance performance.

Our approach also allows us to tease apart stationary and progressive effects, and the localised molecular losses help us to unravel and characterise individual steps in the normal and abnormal processing sequences. They have also led to a revised understanding of a classic problem in visual science: how the critical flicker frequency (the highest frequency that can just be seen) grows with light intensity.",None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,1,2,2,"Award Lecture","2021 Tillyer Award Lecture: The Early Visual Encoding: Computations and Consequences",Brainard,David,"University of Pennsylvania","The visual system takes sensory measurements of the light incident at the eyes and uses these to make perceptual inferences about external world. The sensory measurements do not preserve all of the information available in the light signal. One approach to understanding the implications of the initial stages of visual processing is ideal observer analysis, which evaluates the information available to support psychophysical discriminations at various stages of the early visual representation. We are interested in extending this type of analysis to take into account the statistical structure of natural images. To do so, we developed an open-source computational model of the initial visual encoding, ISETBio (isetbio.org). ISETBio incorporates specification of visual displays, retinal image formation through the eye's optics, spatio-spectral sampling by the retinal cone mosaic, Poisson noise in the cone photopigment excitations, transduction of excitations to photocurrent, and fixational eye movements. In this talk, I will introduce ISETBio and illustrate a set of insights it enables about visual processing by reviewing a number of computational examples. These examples will include ways that combining ISETBio with Bayesian image-reconstruction methods helps us understand how the interaction of the visual encoding and the statistical structure of natural images shapes visual performance.",None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,1,3,3,"Award Lecture","2022 Tillyer Award Lecture: Visual Control of Locomotion in Natural Environments",Hayhoe,Mary,"University of Texas Austin","Control of locomotion is clearly an important role for vision, but one that we know little about. Considerable attention has been devoted to the potential role of retinal motion patterns, generated by self-motion, in steering towards a goal. These motion patterns are determined by an interconnected set of factors, including gaze location, gaze stabilization, the structure of the environment, and the walker’s behavioral goals. We have collected measurements of the eyes, the body, and the 3D environment during locomotion in natural terrains. This has allowed us to explore the resulting retinal motion patterns, and how they might be used to guide behavior. Large variations in head direction during the gait cycle make it problematic for use in steering towards a goal, but gaze stabilization leads to regularities in the retinal motion patterns that could provide a postural control signal during locomotion. Another aspect of the visual control of locomotion is the choice of foot placement in rugged terrain. We examined the role of local height changes in the terrain, and showed that visual selection of footholds reflects a complex interplay between energetic costs and the need for stable foot placement. Thus visual signals about motion and depth act as time-varying local control signals for the momentary disposition of the body rather than steering toward more distant goals.",None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,2,1,4,"Invited Talk","Deep learning-based stimulus optimization for prosthetic vision",Beyeler,Michael,"University of California, Santa Barbara","Visual neuroprostheses are emerging as a promising technology to restore a rudimentary form of vision to people living with incurable blindness. However, phosphenes elicited by current devices often appear artificial and distorted. Although current computational models can predict the neural or perceptual response to an electrical stimulus, an optimal stimulation strategy needs to solve the inverse problem: what is the required stimulus to produce a desired response? Here we frame this as an end-to-end optimization problem, where a deep neural network encoder is trained to invert a psychophysically validated phosphene model that predicts phosphene appearance as a function of stimulus amplitude, frequency, and pulse duration. As a proof of concept, we show that our strategy can produce high-fidelity, patient-specific stimuli representing handwritten digits and segmented images of everyday objects that drastically outperform conventional encoding strategies by relying on smaller stimulus amplitudes at the expense of higher frequencies and longer pulse durations. Overall, this work is an important first step towards improving visual outcomes in visual prosthesis users across a wide range of stimuli.","NIH R00-EY029329",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent work has also enabled observation of immune cell activity in primate retina at the cellular scale. I will describe experiments using in vivo calcium imaging to demonstrate optogenetic restoration of RGC activity in primate fovea and efforts to accelerate progress toward more naturalistic restored vision, using stem cell-derived photoreceptor replacement therapy. Key to the success of all of vision restoration therapies is understanding the impact of periods of long term vision loss on the retina and I will share results examining changes in foveal RGCs in the weeks and months following deafferentation. Finally I will consider the unique perceptual challenges which may arise when restoring light sensitivity to foveal tissue.

We imaged and tracked at ~ 2° eccentricity a 0.9° x 0.9° field of view of the retina in 840 nm. Stimulated in 543 nm, all resolved, spectrally classified cones receive microdoses of varying intensities. The renderer updates for each AOSLO frame (30 frames / sec) an underlying stimulation image buffer, encoding a desired color percept pattern that takes into account the cone locations, cone spectral sensitivity to the 543 nm stimulation light, and the corresponding color percept pixel values. Within one frame, the buffer gets pixelated strip-by-strip at 1 kHz into actual world-fixed microdose intensity values, each centered on a cone within that strip at that instant. The resulting frame of microdoses visually occupies the whole raster view. We showed multiple color percepts to a cone-classified subject, with logging data. The subject saw spatially-varying colors, e.g. a red box moving on a green canvas – these percepts validated the accuracy of the prototype. These initial prototyping experiments allude to the potential of presenting general percepts to a cone-classified subject, at cone-level accuracy in a fully programmable way. The technology allows us to probe neural plasticity and towards generation of novel percepts.","This work was supported by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research under award numbers FA9550-20-1-0195 and FA9550-21-1-0230.",Fong,James,"University of California, Berkeley",Doyle,"Hannah K.","University of California, Berkeley",Herbeck,"Sofie R.","University of California, Berkeley",Tan,Jeffrey,"University of California, Berkeley",Roorda,Austin,"University of California, Berkeley",Ng,Ren,"University of California, Berkeley",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, our understanding of the visual information these RGCs convey to the brain is limited as both the fovea and rarer RGC types have been difficult to address with standard physiology techniques. We addressed this gap in knowledge in vivo, with two macaques expressing GCaMP6s in the foveal ganglion cell layer. Using a fluorescence adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscope, we presented stimuli to the cones while measuring the responses of hundreds of distinct cells. We classified cells with stimuli assessing polarity, spectral tuning, receptive field size, temporal tuning and motion sensitivity. 21% of cells had response properties inconsistent with midget RGCs, including ON-OFF responses, non-canonical spatial receptive fields, direction selectivity and suppressed-by-contrast responses. Our classification enables in vivo functional identification of the rarest foveal RGCs, laying the foundation for future experiments targeting these elusive cells to determine their roles in vision. While the dominance of midget RGCs observed is consistent with the fovea’s specialization for acuity, the unappreciated functional diversity we observed indicates that far more visual processing occurs within the primate fovea than classically thought.","NIH Grants F32 EY032318, P30 EY001319, R01 EY031467, R01 EY021166, R01EY028293, R01 EY032116, T32 EY007125, U24 EY033275 and Research to Prevent Blindness",Godat,Tyler,"University of Rochester",Kohout,Kendall,"University of Rochester",Yang,Qiang,"University of Rochester",Merigan,William,"University of Rochester",Williams,David,"University of Rochester",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This emotion-related modulation is evident even in primary visual cortex (V1), providing a potential neural substrate by which emotionally salient stimuli can affect perception. How does emotional valence information, computed in the amygdala, reach V1? Here we use high-resolution functional MRI to investigate the layer profile and retinotopic distribution of neural activity specific to emotional facial expressions. Across three experiments, human participants viewed centrally presented face stimuli varying in emotional expression and performed a gender judgment task. We found that facial valence sensitivity was evident only in superficial cortical layers and was not restricted to the retinotopic location of the stimuli, consistent with diffuse feedback-like projections from the amygdala. Together, our results provide a feedback mechanism by which the amygdala directly modulates activity at the earliest stage of visual processing. ","This work was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Mental Health (ZIAMH002918; NCT00001360).",Fu,Jason,NIMH,Chai,Yuhui,NIMH,Japee,Shruti,NIMH,Chen,Gang,NIMH,Ungerleider,Leslie,NIMH,Merriam,Elisha,NIMH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Physiological changes in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) have been reported in rodent models of PR loss but this has not been investigated in primates. By expressing both a calcium indicator (GCaMP6s) and an optogenetic actuator (ChrimsonR) in foveal RGCs of a macaque, we reactivate RGCs and assess activity in the weeks and years following PR loss. Cones were ablated with an ultrafast laser delivered through an adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscope (AOSLO). A 0.5 s optogenetic stimulus (1 mW, 640 nm) was delivered to the deafferented RGCs, and GCaMP fluorescence was recorded for 90 s. The calcium response was collected with AOSLO over 10 weeks and the signal decay was fitted with an exponential model. Optogenetic responses in RGCs persisted over 2 years following PR ablation. The mean time to peak calcium response was stable in deafferented RGCs over the 10 weeks (paired t-test, p<0.001), while the mean decay constant of the calcium response decreased 2.1 fold (2.5±0.5 s to 1.2±0.2 s SD) in the 8 weeks post PR ablation. The presence of optogenetic responses 2 years after PR loss and the stable rise time is promising for vision restoration therapies with RGCs. However, the 2-fold reduction in the decay constant of the calcium response suggests that restored activity may be impacted by physiological changes in the inner retina weeks after PR loss.","Funding from the AGI initiative NIH U24 EY033275, CVS core support from NIH P30 EY0001319 An unrestricted grant to the Flaum Eye Institute from Research to Prevent Blindness and the Steven.

1,4,1,12,"Invited Talk","Interactions between Light Exposure and Diurnal Rhythms on the Choroid",Ostrin,Lisa,"University of Houston College of Optometry","Purpose: Increasing evidence demonstrates that light exposure and circadian rhythms plays a role in myopia, with high intensity outdoor light being protective. The choroid may be involved in this mechanism. The goals of our studies were to examine the interaction between light exposure and circadian influences on the choroid. 
Methods: In Experiment 1, choroid diurnal rhythms were investigated during monocular light deprivation in adults using spectral domain optical coherence tomography imaging (SD-OCT). The left eye was light deprived for 20 hours. In Experiment 2, the effects of two hours of high intensity outdoor light exposure on retinal and choroid thickness were investigated and compared to indoor illumination and darkness. 
Results: For Experiment 1, choroid diurnal variation persisted and retinal diurnal variation was eliminated in light deprived eyes. Total retinal and inner segment thicknesses decreased (P < 0.001) and outer segment + RPE thickness increased (P < 0.05) with light deprivation. For Experiment 2, the choroid was significantly thinner during outdoor light exposure compared to indoors and darkness (P < .01), but returned to baseline at follow-up (P > .05). Total retinal thickness was significantly thicker during and after the outdoor compared to indoor and dark conditions (P < .05). 
Conclusions: These studies demonstrate that the choroid is mediated by both intrinsic circadian mechanisms as well as light exposure. Choroidal thickness rhythms were not impacted by short-term light deprivation. Surprisingly, high intensity sunlight resulted in an unexpected thinning of the choroid. These findings have implications regarding the interaction between light exposure, circadian rhythm, and the choroid on myopia.",None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Emmetropization represents a closed-loop feedback system that uses defocus as error signal. It involves two pathways, one stimulating eye growth and the other restraining it. Both are different at several levels (1) different genes (2) different biochemical pathways and pharmacological interventions (3) different modes of retinal image processing. Knowing all this, the question arises why myopia does not limit itself and why undercorrection does not inhibit eye growth as expected from experiments in animal models. We found that only the emmetropic human retina can generate the growth-inhibiting signals when the focal plane is in front of the retina while the myopic retina has largely lost this ability. The functional deficit concerns retinal image processing, not the biochemical signaling cascades to choroid and sclera. Most recently, we found that the emmetropic human retina uses chromatic differences in focus to determine the sign of defocus. Again, we found that the myopic retina has lost this ability. The questions are now: (1) why and when occur the changes in the myopic retina that make myopia an open loop system, (2) what is the biological sense of this functional loss at a time when vision is otherwise normal (with correction) and (3) what are the underlying retinal circuits that seem to “give up”?

The analyses used here can be applied to real neural recordings to identify the strategies at play in the brain.

Secondly, we study how context-specific information may be represented and modified across learning in populations of neurons in a recurrent neural network model of hierarchically-related cortical areas. Motivated by an experimental study investigating neural activities in response to expected and unexpected natural images in mouse visual cortex, we test how the divergence of feedforward and feedback connections underlie differential representations of expected and surprising sensory information across cortical areas and layers.

Answering this question requires theoretical advances that shine light into the ‘black box’ of representations in neural circuits. In this talk, we will demonstrate theoretical approaches that help describe how cognitive and behavioral task implementations emerge from the structure in neural populations and from biologically plausible neural networks. First, we will introduce an analytic theory that connects geometric structures that arise from neural responses (i.e., neural manifolds) to the neural population’s efficiency in implementing a task. In particular, this theory describes a perceptron’s capacity for linearly classifying object categories based on the underlying neural manifolds’ structural properties. Next, we will describe how such methods can, in fact, open the ‘black box’ of distributed neuronal circuits in a range of experimental neural datasets. In particular, our method overcomes the limitations of traditional dimensionality reduction techniques, as it operates directly on the high-dimensional representations, rather than relying on low-dimensionality assumptions for visualization. Furthermore, this method allows for simultaneous multi-level analysis, by measuring geometric properties in neural population data, and estimating the amount of task information embedded in the same population. These geometric frameworks are general and can be used across different brain areas and task modalities, as demonstrated in the work of ours and others, ranging from the visual cortex to parietal cortex to hippocampus, and from calcium imaging to electrophysiology to fMRI datasets. Finally, we will discuss our recent efforts to fully extend this multi-level description of neural populations, by (1) investigating how single neuron properties shape the representation geometry in early sensory areas, and by (2) understanding how task-efficient neural manifolds emerge in biologically-constrained neural networks.

Quantifying crystalline lens morphology during accommodation and aging is essential for understanding basic mechanisms of function and disease (presbyopia and cataract). 
We studied the geometrical changes of the ex-vivo human crystalline lens while simulating different levels of physiological disaccommodation using a motorized lens-stretcher system designed for this purpose. 14 human lenses (11-54 y/o) from donor eyes were radially stretched mounted in the lens-stretcher and immersed in a cuvette filled with balanced salt solution for preservation purposes. Lens geometry and power were characterized using custom-developed high resolution 3-D optical coherence tomography (OCT) and laser ray tracing system coupled with the OCT. 
The lens thickness decreased linearly 81 microns/diopter (D) of simulated disaccommodation (-r=0.87, p<0.001), the diameter increased 76 microns/D (r=0.84, p<0.01), the radius of curvature of the anterior surface increased 0.63 mm/D (r=0.92, p<0.001), the lens surface area increased 1.9 mm2/D (r=0.62, p<0.01) and the lens volume remained constant. The same stretching displacement produced larger deformations in younger than in older lenses. 
Simultaneous high resolution optical and geometrical measurements of stretched lenses therefore match results in vivo and support the Helmholtz theory of accommodation.

However, the ocular immune response to these interventions remains poorly understood. We conducted a proof of concept study using offset aperture adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscopy (AOSLO) to visualize cellular-scale changes in the primate retina following photoreceptor (PR) ablation. Ultrafast 730nm laser exposure at 26.6 - 32.5 J/cm2 was used to create six lesions in four NHPs. Offset aperture images focused on retinal vascular layers were collected with an offset distance of ~10 Airy Disk Diameters from 15 minutes up to three hours after PR ablation. We observed putative immune cells in and around vessels supplying the lesioned areas. Consistent with previous findings in murine models, cells within vessels adhered to the inner wall, exhibited crawling behavior, and had a diameter ranging from ~9.3 - 11.5 µm. Additionally, we observed the emergence of cellular-scale structures above the PR layer that originated in the center of the lesion 15 minutes post-insult and gradually radiated outward. Vascular perfusion was maintained in these regions. Our data suggest that offset aperture imaging offers cellular-scale, label free, in vivo assessment of the retinal response to insult in NHPs and could be employed to advance our understanding of the ocular immune response provoked by disease and therapeutic interventions.","Research reported in this publication was supported by the National Eye Institute of the National Institutes of Health under the AGI initiative NIH U24 EY033275 (to McGregor), R01 EY028293 (Schallek), CVS core support from NIH P30 EY0001319.

Here, we characterize the spectrum of retinal leukocyte kinetics in response to an acute inflammatory stimulus using adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscopy (AOSLO) in living mice.
C57BL/6J male mice were injected intravitreally with 1 µL lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and imaged at 6, 24 and 72 hours after LPS injection using phase contrast and fluorescence AOSLO. Speed of circulating leukocytes (n= 286 cells, 2 mice) was measured with 15kHz point-scan imaging using automated approach (Joseph et al. 2019). Rolling leukocytes (n=300 cells, 5 mice, 6 hrs after LPS) and extravasated cells (n=92 cells, 8 mice) were visualized with time-lapse imaging and manually tracked using ImageJ.
Using our custom AOSLO, we observed leukocyte speeds spanning 5 orders of magnitude in the living retina. The fastest speeds were the circulating leukocytes (13,257.37 ± 7,086.41 µm/s). After LPS, leukocytes roll along the venular wall, where cell speed was 1000x slower (11.45 ± 7.45 µm/s.) When immune cells extravasated into the tissue, cell speed dropped further by 100x (0.3 ± 0.15 µm/s).

This is because at least in layers 1 and 2/3 of V1, the functional micro-architecture for neurons, synapses and blood vessels has been determined using 2-photon imaging (Ohki et al 2005 Nature; Kara and Boyd 2009 Nature; O’Herron et al 2016 Nature). Hence, feature selectivity, e.g., orientation and direction selectivity of spiking, synaptic and hemodynamic activity in layer 2/3 is known. However, the micro-architecture of layer 4 neural activity (spiking and synaptic) along with individual blood vessel responses is unknown because conventional 2-photon imaging cannot access deeper cortical layers. The organizing principles of neural maps and the selectivity of hemodynamic responses is of paramount importance for laminar processing because the thalamic inputs arriving into layer 4 are untuned. 3-photon imaging triples the imaging depth compared to 2-photon imaging. Using this optical technique and high-resolution fMRI, we have determined the extent to which different types of neural (spiking, synaptic) and vascular signals (blood flow from individual vessels and fMRI voxels) are coupled across cortical layers in the cat V1. Our data show systematic changes in selectivity of hemodynamic signals across cortical layers that have clear underpinnings in neural circuitry and the propagation of hemodynamic signals",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This raises the possibility that in some visual tasks, downstream areas that decode V1 signals in order to mediate perception could combine V1 signals at a relevant topographic scale—e.g., at the scale of orientation columns. If this were the case, then the fundamental unit of information would be individual columns rather than single neurons, and to account for the subject’s behavior in a perceptual task, it would be necessary and sufficient to consider the summed activity of the thousands of neurons within each column.

1,7,4,27,"Invited Talk","Development of natural scene processing continues after the critical period for ocular dominance plasticity closes",Kuhlman,Sandra,"Carnegie Mellon University","The development of the visual system is known to be shaped by early-life experience.  How complex responses to naturalistic scenes emerge from neurons that are innately tuned to simple orientations is an active area of investigation.  Using 2-photon calcium in awake mice, we found that natural scene discriminability increases by 75% between the ages of 4 to 6 weeks in primary visual cortex. This increase in decoding accuracy is accompanied by a shift in neuronal preference towards natural scenes. Natural scene discriminability, therefore, continues to improve past the peak of the critical period for ocular dominance plasticity at postnatal day (p) 28. Notably visual deprivation specifically from p28 to p42 interfered with the full development of this preference shift and impaired natural scene decoding accuracy.  We are currently exploring the circuit basis for this protracted development.  We speculate that a sequential progression in which neurons first prefer simple stimuli such as oriented bars of light (grating stimuli) prior to the development of selectivity for complex features may help ensure that the spatial organization of receptive fields is maintained as the system becomes refined to represent salient visual cues as animals expand their behavioral repertoire and learn to navigate complex environments.","NIH R01EY024678",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This presentation will review several studies from my lab that used OCT and OCTA to investigate retinal characteristics of people with SZ, with a focus on characterizing within-group heterogeneity. Results indicate that: 1) retinal thinning is present at the macula, but not until several years after the first psychotic episode; 2) reductions in microvasculature density are observable as early as the first episode and worsen over time at a greater rate than expected by age alone; 3) microvasculature reductions are present in both the superficial and deep retinal layers; and 4) issues such as diabetes, smoking, and obesity must be carefully considered when studying the retina in SZ.

3,8,2,29,"Invited Talk","Early prediction of multiple sclerosis using scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO) video sequence data with a Deep Learning (DL) based approach",Xing,Joe,"C. Light Technologies, Inc.","Introduction: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory disease (IMID) of the central nervous system (CNS). Early identification of MS, especially as a screening method for at-risk individuals, is crucial to delay disease progression and improve patient outcomes by preventing future irreversible neurologic damage. In this work, we utilize well-validated tracking scanning laser ophthalmoscope (TSLO) image to predict MS compared to the unaffected controls. While traditional Machine Learning (ML) methods, such as Logistic Regression (LR), have demonstrated a strong predictive power [Mauro F. Pinto et al., 2020] in disease identification, we propose the use of a novel DL based model. Though the use of Deep Neural Network (DNN), this model can have a much higher learning capacity to capture latent features embedded in the retinal images. We hypothesize that such latent information, often hidden in ML feature engineering processes, plays an important role for the prediction of disease and can be well represented by DL models. Objectives: To establish a DL based model capable of learning latent image features to provide predictive power for the presence of MS. Aims: Utilize a deep convolutional neural network to extract the retinal coding and implement a recurrent neural network to learn the temporal correlations in video sequences. Methods: Our approaches were tested using a 250-subject MS/control database collected at the UCSF. Patients with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)< 4 are compared to healthy subjects. Both raw retinal images and the frequency and spatial patterns of the eye motion are combined to construct a hybrid image, denoted as “retinal coding”, and directly fed to the DL model for training and testing. Results: Preliminary results on predictive power were measured using Area-under-Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve, sensitivity, and specificity, as well as an F-1 score. We observe an AUC of 0.920, sensitivity of 0.90, specificity of 0.89 and F-1 score of 0.89 using the DL model to distinguish MS from controls, which outperforms the baseline LR model by 24%. Conclusions: This work can be considered as a proof-of-concept concerning the possibility of identifying MS disease using a DL based approach. The results demonstrate the possibility of predicting early-stage MS and understanding disease’s dynamics. Such end-to-end model could be generalizable and trained on other disease states.",None,Green,Ari,"University of California San Francisco",Sheehy,Christy,"C.

Leveraging the multimodal synergy of combining dynamic methods of OCT/OCTA, with Adaptive Optics SLO, clinicians have new opportunities to better appreciate some of the complexities of human disease. Serial OCTA imaging can reveal inconsistencies in retinal perfusion not appreciated on single images and can be used to measure activity status of sickle cell microvasculopathy. This approach facilitates earlier detection and immediate assessment of disease burden. AOSLO imaging provides cellular level resolution for confirmation of these OCTA events. En face OCT reflectance images which accompany OCTA studies offer a glimpse of the macrophage-like cellular activity above the retinal surface which responds to systemically instigated vascular events below. The complementary use of AOSLO to characterize morphology of these cells provides clues to their activation status and potential role in tissue maintenance and repair.

1,8,4,31,"Invited Talk","In vivo study of higher-order retinal hemodynamics in human retinal capillaries",Zhang,Yuhua,"Doheny Eye Institute, Department of Ophthalmology, University of California - Los Angeles","Pulsatile erythrocyte flow in human retinal capillaries reflects the capillary-blood flow system's mechanical condition and represents a fundamental functioning aspect of retinal microcirculation. Inside the capillary, the erythrocytes are continuously accelerated and decelerated by systemic pressure and hydrostatic and osmotic pressures periodically with the heartbeat. This process can be described by the Navier-Stokes equation: ρ(∂v/∂t+v∙∇v)=-∇P+∇∙T, ρ is the density, v is the velocity, P is the pressure, and T represents the stress tensor. The time variation of the flow velocity (∂v/∂t), i.e., the acceleration, is a higher-order dynamics term (compared to velocity) of the pulsatile flow, reflects the temporal variation of the hemodynamic forces, and informs the dynamic mechanical properties of the erythrocyte-capillary system. Higher-order dynamics relating to the acceleration of the erythrocytes in retinal capillaries have not been investigated in the human eye due to inadequate technical measures. This study aims to characterize the higher-order retinal hemodynamics and identify sensitive biomarkers for quantifying age-related changes in the retinal microcirculation using high-speed adaptive optics near-confocal ophthalmoscopy. In human subjects in normal physical health with different ages, we demonstrate that higher-order hemodynamic characteristics of the erythrocyte flow in the retinal capillary can disclose age-related differences in the retinal microcirculation.","NIH R01EY024378), W.

GCaMP6s was expressed in three female macaques. Adaptive optics ophthalmoscopy was used to image fluorescence (488nm ex, 520/35nm em) from RGCs whose RF centers were driven by cones in the central 36 arcmin of the fovea and additional RGCs driven by cones in the central 6 arcmin of the foveola. Using cone isolating and luminance flicker (1.3deg, 0.15Hz, LED 420nm, 530nm, 660nm), we derived cone weights in over 250 RGCs. Using drifting gratings (1.9deg, 6Hz, 4-50c/deg, 561nm), we derived the spatial frequency responses of 15 L vs. M cone opponent RGCs at the foveolar center. Employing computational modeling (ISETbio), we inferred the full spatial difference of gaussians center and surround structure for those 15 cells. Of the 34 foveolar RGCs, 44% exhibited L vs. M cone opponency, 15% were L+M ON, 6% were -L-M OFF, and 35% showed only L or only M responses. The spatial frequency response functions of 12/15 L vs. M opponent cells peaked at high spatial frequencies (25-40c/deg) and had a strong bandpass characteristic.

Bayesian reliability (inverse variance) weighting of inputs is predicted by Maximum Likelihood Estimation Theory and has some psychophysical support, but evidence for neural reliability weighting is sparse and neural modeling of reliability weighting is tricky.   However, reliability averaging is just one possible perceptual weighted average.  An alternative – nonlinear magnitude-weighted averaging – was suggested by Schrodinger in 1926 to account for suprathreshold binocular perception and is available to repurpose for other sensory cue combinations.  We identified macaque suppressive binocular neurons that implement nonlinear magnitude-weighted averaging and approximate Bayesian averaging, without suffering the computational difficulties that Bayesian averaging implies.  We then applied the binocular modeling to suppressive multisensory (visual-tactile, audio-tactile, and audio-visual) neurons.  Although magnitude-weighting is a better fit than reliability-weighted averaging for cortical firing rates (in all four cases and in three different species), nonlinear magnitude-weighted averaging is well correlated with reliability averaging.   Magnitude-weighted averaging could serve as a surrogate for Bayesian calculations; mildly suppressive binocular and multisensory bimodal neurons could be neural correlates of Bayesian-like computation in the brain.","MAM: NIH NS039460; KD: 1R01EY027402-02, T32EY007135, and core grant P30EY008126; VAB & AMP: Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs & the Defense Health Agency J9 Research and Health Directorate, Defense Health 6.7 Program #DP_67.2_17_J9_1757, work unit # H1814.

Here, we investigated how perisaccadic neural responses during free-viewing of natural images relate to the tuning properties of neurons in primary visual cortex (V1). We recorded from V1 in two marmoset monkeys using linear arrays as they freely viewed full-field natural scenes. We found that on average neural responses time-locked to saccade onset exhibited an early suppression followed by a post-saccadic rebound in excitatory activity. To determine whether the latency of these saccade dynamics varied with neural tuning properties we mapped tuning for spatial and temporal frequency, and orientation selectivity. In those trials marmosets free-viewed flashed full-field gratings that varied in spatial frequency and orientation. Among the neurons with significant orientation tuning, we observe a significant correlation between spatial frequency preference and the latency of post-saccadic rebound, with neurons tuned to higher spatial frequencies responding later.

Experimental deformation amplitudes showed dependence on the animal model, with porcine scleras exhibiting greater inter-site variation (displacement of S, I was up to four times greater than that of N, T), while rabbit scleras exhibited at most 40% of displacement differences between all sites. Both models showed significant (p<.001) differences in the temporal deformation profile between sclera and (C), but similarities in all scleral locations, suggesting that the scleral temporal profile is independent of scleral thickness variations. The FEM estimated an elastic modulus of 1.84 ± 0.30 MPa (I) to 6.04 ± 2.11 MPa (TE) for the porcine sclera. The use of scleral air-puff imaging is promising for noninvasive investigation of structural changes in the sclera associated with myopia and for monitoring possible modulation of scleral stiffness with myopia treatment.","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme European Project Imcustomeye (H2020-ICT-2017 Ref. 779960); European Research Council (2018-ADG-SILKEYE-833106); Spanish Government10.13039/100014440 (CSIC JAE Intro Fellowship); L'Oréal-UNESCO “For Women in Science” Spain; Spanish Government Juan de la Cierva-Incorporation Fellowship (IJC2018-037508-I); Spanish Government PID2020-115191RB-I00; Fundacja na rzecz Nauki Polskiej (MAB/2019/12); National Agency for Academic Exchange, Polish Government (NAWA ULAM/2020/1/00176); NIH NIE P30EY 001319; Unrestricted Funds Research to Prevent Blindness, NY",Villegas,Lupe,"Instituto de Óptica ""Daza de Valdés"", Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas (IO-CSIC), Madrid, Spain","de la Hoz","Andrés ","Instituto de Óptica ""Daza de Valdés"", Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas (IO-CSIC), Madrid, Spain",Bronte-Ciriza,David,"CNR – IPCF, Istituto per i Processi Chimico-Fisici, Messina, Italy",Varea,Alejandra,"Instituto de Óptica ""Daza de Valdés"", Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas (IO-CSIC), Madrid, Spain",Martínez-Enríquez,Eduardo,"Instituto de Óptica ""Daza de Valdés"", Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas (IO-CSIC), Madrid, Spain",Curatolo,Andrea,"ICTER and Institute of Physical Chemistry, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, Poland",Germann,"James A.","Instituto de Óptica ""Daza de Valdés"", Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas (IO-CSIC), Madrid, Spain",Marcos,Susana,"The Center for Visual Science, University of Rochester, Rochester, New York, USA",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, much remains unknown about the underlying circuit mechanisms. Using the marmoset, a small New World monkey with a smooth brain, we examined laminar and cell class distinctions during pre-saccadic attention in motion selective areas MT/MTC. In a saccade foraging task, marmosets made a saccade from a central fixation point to one of three equally eccentric random dot field stimuli. We positioned the stimuli such that one foraged location overlapped the receptive fields of neurons under study and examined how tuning functions for motion direction changed. Tuning curves were fit with an adjusted Von Mises curve that estimates baseline, gain, and tuning width. We found in two animals that neurons on average exhibited increases in baseline and gain with pre-saccadic attention, but no changes in tuning width. In a single animal we were able to dissect the population by cell class and layer. We found that increases in gain were predominantly among broad spiking neurons in superficial layers whereas additive increases in rate were shared across layers and cell types. This suggests that superficial layer broad spiking neurons, the putative projection neurons that would relay information to downstream cortical areas, have a privileged role for encoding enhanced motion sensitivity during pre-saccadic attention.","SC, AB, and JFM from NIH EY030998; GS from NSF GRF 2020305476",Coop,Shanna,"Stanford University",Sarch,Gabriel,"Carnegie Mellon Univeristy ",Mitchell,Jude,"University of Rochester",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the prevalence of conscious visual abilities in CB is less clear. Having developed a new method to assess vision inside perimetrically-defined blind fields, we found that >50% of subacute CB patients (<6 months post-stroke) can consciously discriminate global motion inside their blind field. Here, we asked if they can also discriminate orientation of static targets, which do not typically elicit blindsight. In 10 subacute patients, we mapped their intact and blind hemifields using static, non-flickering, 1cpd Gabors across a wide range of luminance contrasts. Blind-field locations were labeled “preserved” if performance was >72.5% correct. Considering overall performance, only 1 participant had preserved static orientation perception in the blind-field. However, this increased to 4 participants when only considering performance at high contrasts (>50%), all of whom reported awareness of stimuli. Thus, early after V1 damage, conscious percepts for oriented, high-contrast, static targets can remain inside CB fields, similar in incidence to global motion discriminations.

","University of Rochester","During fixation, an incessant drift of the eye keeps the image impinging on the retina always in motion.   Previous work indicated that luminance modulations from ocular drift serve important visual functions in emmetropes (Intoy & Rucci, 2020; Clark et al 2022). However, it remains unknown how ocular drift varies under myopia, a visual impairment commonly caused by eye elongation. We measured eye movements in 19 individuals with varying degrees of myopia (-0.25D to -6.5D) using a digital Dual-Purkinje Image eye-tracker, a recently developed system with sub-arcminute resolution. Subjects observed stimuli monocularly with vision corrected via a Badal optometer.  They engaged in two high-acuity tasks:  (a) resolution of a 20/20 line of an eye chart (5 evenly spaced tumbling E optotypes); and (b) a more natural task where subjects were presented with images of distant faces (1⁰) and asked to report the image’s gaze direction. We show ocular drift characteristics differ in myopes relative to emmetropes. Drift was faster and less curved in myopic observers. On the retina, these changes result in luminance modulations that amplify low spatial frequencies at the expense of high spatial frequencies, so that high-frequency signals are effectively weaker in myopes These results are consistent with the proposal that fine spatial vision strongly relies on oculomotor-induced luminance modulations and emphasize the importance of considering fine eye movements in myopia.","R01 EY018363,  Meta/Facebook Reality Labs",Cox,"Michele A.","University of Rochester",Wu,Ruei-Jr,"University of Rochester",Intoy,Janis,"University of Rochester",Rucci,Michele,"University of Rochester",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,10,8,42,"Contributed Poster","Oculomotor influences on retinal input signals in myopia",Cox,"Michele A.","Center for Visual Science, University of Rochester","Studies of emmetropization have traditionally focused on the spatial characteristics of visual input signals.  Yet the input to the retina is not a two-dimensional pattern but a temporally-varying luminance flow. The temporal structure of this flow is predominately determined by eye movements, as the human eyes move incessantly.  Even when fixating on a single point, a persistent motion known as ocular drift reformats the luminance flow in a way that counterbalances the spectra of natural scenes.  It is established that emmetropes are highly sensitive to these luminance modulations. However, their visual consequences in myopia and hyperopia are unknown. Here, we first review how the temporal-frequency distribution of retinal input signals varies with the amount of ocular drift. We then use a detailed optical/geometrical model of the eye to study how the eye movements jointly shape retinal input as a function of refraction. We show that, within the temporal range of sensitivity of the retina, the spatial frequency distribution of the input signals conveys signed information about defocus. Specifically, for a given degree of defocus, myopic retinas experience more power from low spatial frequency stimuli than hyperopic retinas. These redistribution of input power may have a consequence during eye growth supporting the proposal that eye movements should be taken into consideration in the process of emmetropization.

Quantifying such changes poses challenges due to the nature of the lens’ materials. One approach has been to use finite element models and deformation profiles of lenses to estimate elastic moduli. In this work, this approach is extended to accommodation data for individual subjects. 11 subjects aged 20 to 30 were measured in an OCT system to record their accommodative response to a 4.5D stimulus. Lens surfaces were reconstructed from a diameter of 6mm and the periphery of the lens was estimated using eigenlenses method. The resulting profiles were used as input for a finite element model of accommodation. The lens was modelled with two primary components (nucleus and cortex) with elastic moduli for each region set as a variable. A load of 0.05-0.06N was used to approximate the accommodative process. An inverse modeling procedure was used to estimate cortical and nuclear moduli, by minimizing the difference between experimental and simulated surfaces at maximum deformed state. Estimated mean nuclear and cortical moduli values were 1.42 kPa (SD 1.16) and 7.07 kPa (SD 4.81). For all lenses evaluated, nuclear modulus was lower than cortical modulus. Age dependence was found for the average elastic modulus (R2 0.83) and for nuclear (R2 0.5) and cortical (R2 0.45) moduli.

To test for lexical effects on color memory, the same observers grouped 1625 Munsell samples before the memory experiment and provided focal colors and unconstrained color terms for the groups. They also named the remembered color after each 300-sec trial.
Delay affected every measure of matching performance. Matches were more variable for 10-sec delays than in the simultaneous condition. Simultaneous matches were near the test colors (∆E=2.8), but the distance from the test color (bias) increased for 10-sec delays, generally in the direction of increased saturation, with variation across test colors. These measures increased little between 10 and 300 sec.
To test for lexical effects, an “attraction score” measured how much matches were biased by the observers’ unique focal colors. Attraction scores for simultaneous matches were near zero, but some colors showed substantial attraction to the focal colors at 10- and 300-sec delays.

Here, we argue that may be a missed opportunity.  From a large literature, we identify a set of visual tests that have distinguished individuals prior to or near the first psychotic episode or that have shown group differences independently of illness duration. Such tests have revealed moderate-to-large patient differences unexplainable by medication or generalized deficits. For example, self-reported visual perceptual distortions have already longitudinally predicted impending psychosis in large samples. Possibly predictive psychophysical tests include contrast sensitivity, backward masking, collinear facilitation, stereoscopic depth perception, contour integration, visual shape completion, and restricted fixational patterns during free viewing. Possible brain based markers include visual thalamo-cortical hyperconnectivity, decreased gamma band power during visual detection, and reduced occipital P1 amplitudes (EEG) during passive viewing. Promising retinal markers include reduced cone a- and b-wave amplitudes and photopic negative response (ERG). The foregoing assessments are often brief, well-tolerated, simple to administer, and well-described mechanistically.

Human color vision is informed by the relative activations of the long-, medium-, and short-wavelength sensitive cones. We have developed a display that can produce a variety of color sensations using only a single wavelength of light, by programming the activity levels of the three cone types at population scales. 
Methods
With an Adaptive Optics Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope, we image the retina at 840 nm over a 0.9° x 0.9° field and track the eye’s fixational motion in order to deliver discrete microdoses of 543 nm light to ~2500 individual cones per frame. Using each cone type’s spectral sensitivity to 543 nm, we can recapitulate the relative activations consistent with colors that are distinct from the stimulating laser, resulting in percepts of uniform colored squares that appear stable in the world.
Results
Using stimulation from only 543 nm light, we can elicit color percepts ranging from green to red-orange in 2 subjects who have cone spectral types classified in a region of their retina. Additionally, we find through color matching data that the distinct color percepts are lost for intentional misdeliveries that exceed 30% of the cone diameter in both subjects.
Conclusions
These results demonstrate our system’s ability to track the retina at high speed, stimulate with cone-level precision, and generate color percepts by directly programming the activity of the human cone mosaic. These technical capabilities provide a novel platform for studying color vision.","This work was supported by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research under award numbers FA9550-20-1-0195 and FA9550-21-1-0230 and by the National Institutes of Health under award number R01EY023591.",Fong,James,"Department of Electrical Engineering & Computer Sciences, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, United States",Wang,Congli,"Department of Electrical Engineering & Computer Sciences, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, United States",Herbeck,"Sofie R.","Department of Electrical Engineering & Computer Sciences, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, United States",Vanston,"John E.","Herbert Wertheim School of Optometry and Vision Science, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, United States",Boehm,"Alexandra E.","Herbert Wertheim School of Optometry and Vision Science, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, United States",Schmidt,"Brian P.","Herbert Wertheim School of Optometry and Vision Science, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, United States",Tuten,"William S.","Herbert Wertheim School of Optometry and Vision Science, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, United States",Roorda,Austin,"Herbert Wertheim School of Optometry and Vision Science, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, United States",Ng,Ren,"Department of Electrical Engineering & Computer Sciences, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, United States",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Erythropsia has been observed historically by people whose retinas were exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light (e.g., aphakes or pseudophakes implanted with unfiltered intraocular lenses).  Erythropsia is not fully understood, but has been thought to be related to photochemical damage to short-wavelength (S) cones. Erythropsia can also occur in normal phakic eyes during intense white light adaptation. When I stare at the sunlit white siding on the southern wall of my house, after several seconds, the color changes from white to a brilliant magenta, with the central 1-2º of visual angle spared. All details in the siding fade except for the spared center. In another 10-20 seconds, the magenta turns to bluish cyan, and the previously invisible details reappear with exaggerated contrast.  These observations are reminiscent of the color of S-cone increments on white adapting fields (Drum & Sternheim (2005) JOSA A: 22, 2107-19).  S cones are insensitive relative to M and L cones on dim backgrounds, but they do not light-adapt like M and L cones and become relatively more sensitive at moderate adapting levels.  At still higher adapting levels, S cones saturate (become unresponsive) leaving the increment a tritanopic cyan. The present observations imply that S cones initially fail to adapt to a bright white field, but then saturate, leaving the observer tritanopic.","No funding or conflicts",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Introduction: Dysmetria, the inability to measure distance in muscular tasks correctly, is a common clinical feature of cerebellar injury. Objective quantification of reaching accuracy for clinical assessment is lacking, and the emerging VR technology with hand-tracking offers a promising opportunity to examine the speed, accuracy, and consistency of hand movements and proprioceptive function.

Methods: 29 individuals (10 CS patients and 19 age-matched not-disabled controls) performed a task measuring reaching accuracy on the VR headset (Oculus Quest 2). 50% of the trials displayed a visible rendering of the hand (visible hand condition), and 50% did not (invisible hand condition).

Results: Reaching error was higher in CS compared to age-matched controls in both visible and invisible hand conditions. Reaching error was higher in the invisible hand condition compared to the visible hand condition in healthy controls, right CS, left CS but not in bilateral CS patients. The average time per trial was higher in patients than in controls.   

Discussion: VR technology promises to be a non-invasive and rapid approach to quantifying fine motor functions in clinical settings. Further studies are needed to examine quantitative changes in reaching accuracy during post-stroke progression.

In this study, we use a programmable see-through head-mounted visual simulator (SimVis Gekko) to analyze the effect of neural adaptation on the perceived image quality of different bifocal corrections (BC) with different balances of energy between far and near, and for different transitions between adaptation and test. Eight subjects judged a video sequence of urban natural images, through two monofocal corrections (0 and 3D) and nine BCs (far/near balance from 90/10 to 10/90 and an addition of 3.00D), optically simulated monocularly. Two initial adaptation states of 10s were used: 0.00D-SHARP and 3.00D-BLUR, followed a transition from these states to the BC that can be ABRUPT (with 1, 5 or 30s of adaptation), or SMOOTH (linear transition lasting 1, 5 or 30s). Our results show a significant increase in perceptual quality after adaptation to BLUR, particularly for intermediate energy balances.

Using a large, bipartite light booth lit by two separate 7-channel LED systems, observers were adapted to uniform and mixed illuminations of simulated illuminant A, illuminant D65, and 12000 K daylight. A psychophysical staircase method determined observers’ white points and their state of sensory adaptation along the daylight and Planckian loci under each heterochromatic or single-color lighting condition. Under heterochromatic conditions, observers’ state of chromatic adaptation fell in between the points of chromatic adaptation when adapted to each individual light source, although there was significant variation between observers. These results suggest that observers’ white points should be individually determined for studies of color perception in heterochromatic environments using methods similar to those used in this study.

Here we extended these results to examine the color appearance of spatially varying patterns, which contain a wide range of luminance levels. The images were 1/f luminance noise and were briefly alternated with a gray background with the same mean luminance. The noise was shown on each trial with a uniform chromaticity, which was varied across trials over a grid of values spanning the LvsM and SvsLM cone-opponent axes. Observers categorized each noise image as gray or one of the four unique (RGBY) or binary (RB,BG,GY,YR) hues. The perceived achromatic gamut for the noise again tended to vary along bluish-yellowish directions, but was markedly broader compared to the uniform patches. The broadening of the gray category may partly reflect attributions of some of the color to the illuminant, a tendency which may be stronger in the spatially variegated patterns.","Supported by EY-010834",Bennett,Emersongrace,"University of Nevada, Reno",Webster,Michael,"University of Nevada, Reno",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to limited resources on board long-term spaceflight missions, early disease diagnosis and prognosis of SANS become unviable. Moreover, the current retinal imaging techniques onboard the international space station (ISS), such as optical coherence tomography (OCT), ultrasound imaging, and fundus photography, require an expert to distinguish between SANS and similar ophthalmic diseases. With the advent of Deep Learning, diagnosing diseases (such as diabetic retinopathy) from structural retinal images are being automated. In this study, we propose a lightweight convolutional neural network incorporating an EfficientNet encoder for detecting SANS from OCT images. We used 6303 OCT B-scan images for training/validation (80%/20% split) and 945 for testing. Our model achieved 84.2% accuracy on the test set, i.e., 85.6% specificity, and 82.8% sensitivity.

There are a growing number of vision restoration treatments that recruit people with ULV or restore vision to the ULV level. At present, limited standardized outcome measures are available to assess visual potential before and after such vision restoration treatments. The ULV toolkit was developed as a standardized outcome measure for people with ULV. Three virtual reality (VR) based modules were developed to assess visual information gathering, hand-eye coordination and wayfinding in people with ULV. Each module consisted of a range of visually guided tasks related to activities of daily life (e.g., direction of motion of cars, flipping a light switch, boarding a train). Each correct/incorrect response was scored as ‘1’/ ‘0’. These raw scores were then analyzed to estimate item difficulty (item measure) and person ability (person measure). Item measures showed a wide range of difficulty levels that can be used to evaluate visual performance in people with ULV. Person measures were correlated with estimated logMAR visual acuity as well as completion rates, number of collisions and reaction times. This study bridges a big gap in the field of ULV where little is known about visual potential and usefulness in activities of daily life. VR provides portability and consistency for testing across participants with ULV thereby allowing for standardization of measurements across vision restoration studies.","NEI R01EY028452 (GD), K99EY033031(AK), Research to Prevent Blindness",Sadeghi,Roksana,"Johns Hopkins University",Swanson,Thom,BaltiVirtual,Gee,Will,BaltiVirtual,Dagnelie,Gislin,"Johns Hopkins University",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have suggested this by finding faster search times for novel targets when searching on backgrounds observers are currently adapted to. However, this provides only an indirect measure of salience. Here, we developed a more direct measure of the impact of adaptation on feature salience. Backgrounds were oriented 1/f noise images with power confined within 15 deg of horizontal or vertical. Targets were 5 c/deg Gabor patches centered on the 8 deg backgrounds. Observers simultaneously adapted to the horizontal or vertical backgrounds shown on the left or right of fixation. A 250ms test probe then showed the Gabor patch on the same background (horizontal or vertical) on both sides. The target orientation was adjusted on one side until it appeared as conspicuous as a fixed target on the other side. Settings were made for fixed targets ranging from 10 to 45 deg from the backgrounds. For most conditions/observers, the salience matches required a smaller orientation offset on the same- vs. different-adapt background. These results support a functional role of adaptation in highlighting novelty by potentially “unmasking” the target from its background, and emphasize the importance of considering adaptation aftereffects not only for isolated targets but within the stimulus contexts they are embedded in.",CA-237827,"Lee Corsini",Kassandra,"University of Nevada, Reno","K Abbey",Craig,"University of California, Santa Barbara","A.

For repeated color changes, vision may learn to adapt faster to maintain accurate perception. We previously reported that wearing red glasses repeatedly caused the world to appear less and less reddish when the glasses were first put on, as measured by the appearance of unique yellow. Here, we tested the appearance of a larger range of colors. 13 observers wore red glasses for 5hr/day for 5 days. Observers were tested with pairs of 1.5 deg filled color circles, centered within a 6deg black square on a background image. 13 colors were chosen from LAB space comprising unique and intermediate hues at two contrast levels, and one gray. Observers rated the difference between each possible color pair on a scale of 0 to 9. Observers performed the task before and immediately after putting the glasses on, and after 25, 50 and 75 min of wear. Wearing red glasses caused all colors to appear reddish and be rated as relatively similar. As observers adapted, colors gradually regained more normal appearance, and the similarity between color pairs decreased. Critically, over days, color pairs appeared more dissimilar immediately after putting on the glasses (p<1e-6). Multi-dimensional scaling analysis of the similarity data revealed a uniform expansion of color space across days. Thus, observers learned to immediately adjust their perception of many colors with repeated experience.

Recent work has shown that this transformation is highly structured: within human temporal sensitivity, saccades deliver power that increases in proportion to spatial frequency (SF) up to a critical frequency and remains constant beyond that. Importantly, the critical SF increases with decreasing amplitude. Therefore, at sufficiently low SFs, larger saccades effectively deliver stronger input signals to the retina. Here we tested whether this input reformatting has the predicted perceptual consequences, by examining how large and small saccades (6o & 1o) affect contrast sensitivity. We measured relative sensitivity at two SFs: a reference (0.5 cpd), equal to the critical SF for the small saccade, and a probe at either a lower or higher SF (0.1/2.5 cpd). We predicted that large saccades enhance visibility only when the probe has a lower SF than the reference. Subjects (N=7) made instructed saccades while presented with a plaid of overlapping orthogonal gratings at the two SFs and reported which grating was more visible. Results closely follow theoretical predictions: psychometric functions following small and large saccades only differed with the lower SF probe, in which case the larger saccade significantly enhanced visibility. In sum, saccades enable selectivity not only in the spatial domain, but also in the spatial-frequency domain.","This work was supported by Meta Reality Labs and National Institutes of Health grants EY018363 (MR) and EY07977 (JV).",Cox,"Michele A.","University of Rochester",Intoy,Janis,"University of Rochester",Victor,Jonathan,"Feil Family Brain and Mind Research Institute, Weill Cornell Medical College",Yang,Bin,"University of Rochester",Zhao,Zhetuo,"University of Rochester",Rucci,Michele,"University of Rochester",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,10,26,59,"Contributed Poster","A unifying framework for perceptual decision-making",Lin,Ying,"University of Rochester","Perceptual decision making (PDM) has been studied using two approaches. Threshold measurement is predominant used in psychophysics, while reaction times (RT) with associated models have been used to estimate components of PDM (i.e., drift rate). To test if these two approaches reflect overlapping mechanisms, we conducted 3 experiments: a motion, a static orientation, and a dynamic orientation task. DT is the shortest stimulus presentation time sufficient to make accurate perceptual decisions. RTs and choices were fitted by a drift diffusion model (DDM). We expected a close relationship between DTs and drift rates, allowing us to accurately predict DTs from RT. In the motion task, we found a close relation between the empirical DTs and the DTs predicted by the DDM. Surprisingly, in the static task, there was little correlation between the two; DTs, improved monotonically with higher contrast, but drift rates saturated at 6%. We hypothesize that this mismatch is due to the information being available immediately in the static task, without needing to accumulate new evidence. Thus, we developed a novel dynamic orientation task that mimics the dynamic nature of the motion task and found a similar relation between DTs and drift rates. In summary, we show a close link between DTs and drift rate for the two dynamic tasks. This result supports the conceptualization of drift rate as a proxy for perceptual sensitivity but only for task where new information becomes available over time.",None,Chen,Zhen,"University of Rochester",Reynoso,Jose,"The City College of New York ",Haefner,Ralf,"University of Rochester",Tadin,Duje,"University of Rochester",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,10,27,60,"Contributed Poster","Bayesian inference and adaptation in neural responses",Manalansan,Jake,"University of Nevada Reno","Many of the perceptual changes induced by adaptation can be captured in a Bayesian framework, in which adaptation renormalizes neural responses to weak or strong stimuli, consistent with correcting the likelihood to match the prior (Emery and Webster VSS 2020). We explored what this model implies about Bayesian estimation at the level of an individual neuron or channel. The prior corresponds to what the neuron expects to see, but the adaptation causes responses to match what it expects. If the decoder does not “know” the neuron’s adaptation state (Series et al 2009), these adjustments effectively flatten priors for dimensions the neuron adapts to, preserving expectations only for information that it does not adapt to, such as how signals deviate from the predicted value.  Bayesian-like estimates of these deviations can be computed within the neuron because the shape of the prior is instantiated in the neuron’s contrast response function (CRF). For example, for a Gaussian prior the corresponding CRF is a cumulative Gaussian. Steeper CRFs bias responses more toward the mean. The biases approximate but do not equal the Bayesian posterior. If, like adaptation, the decoding does not account for this approximation, then the interpreted stimulus value is distorted relative to the Bayes estimate. This may underlie the distortions evident in some perceptual dimensions, such as nonlinearities in perceived contrast.","Supported by EY010834",Emery,Kara,"New York University",Rudd,Michael,"University of Nevada Reno",Webster,Michael,"University of Nevada Reno",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

VSS is a serious but poorly understood disorder (prevalence 1.4-3.3%). Symptoms of VSS can interfere with daily tasks like driving and reading. However, few studies have examined VSS, and quantitative measurements of symptoms are lacking. We developed a matching task in which participants with VSS adjusted parameters of simulated visual snow on a computer screen; participants modified the contrast, density, speed, and size of an array of dots to match their visual snow. Simulated snow was generated by random independent draws from a binary distribution controlled by the contrast parameter. Snow density was adjusted by setting a proportion of pixels equal to the background luminance. The speed setting determined the lifetime of each snow element, after which it was replaced. Dot size was adjusted by moving closer or further from the display and recording the viewing distance, as perceived snow elements were generally smaller than one pixel viewed from 0.5 m. Individuals with VSS said the simulated snow closely resembled their perceived snow, and parameter settings were consistent across trials. Simulated snow contrast settings were relatively low and dot size was relatively small. This task provides a quantitative assessment of visual snow percepts, which may facilitate assessment of treatments/therapies and testing of hypotheses about underlying mechanisms.","This work was supported by funding from the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation (T32 EY025187, DGE-1734815, R25 NS117356)",Lee,Michael,"University of Minnesota, Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Neurosciences",Mulder,Carter,"University of Minnesota, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences",Engel,Stephen,"University of Minnesota, Department of Psychology",Schallmo,Michael-Paul,"University of Minnesota, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent success in classifying single RGCs with in vivo calcium imaging and in vivo optogenetic activation of RGCs en masse now bring such a paradigm within reach. As a first step, we demonstrate the optogenetic stimulation of single foveal RGCs in the living macaque.
RGCs in an anesthetized female macaque were stimulated and imaged using adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscopy. Co-expression of ChrimsonR and GCaMP6s was achieved via intravitreal injection of a viral vector. On each trial, a targeted soma was exposed to four, 12.5 µm diameter flashes of 0.8 second duration. Targets were limited to those RGCs with at least a 20 µm separation from their nearest neighbors. The GCaMP responses to the flash of both targeted and nearby cells were imaged and the ΔF/F for each soma’s response was averaged over the flashes. The ΔF/F values were used to calculate z-scores for each cell’s response. Five cells were found to have responded significantly (z-score > 3.5) with no significant response from their neighbors.
We can directly activate single RGCs in the living eye and measure the resulting calcium signal, the first step toward a method to measure the sensations produced by individual RGCs in the awake behaving monkey.

Dynamic visual acuity (DVA) refers to the ability to visualize objects in motion.  Gravitational (G)-transitions can occur during spaceflight inducing rapid sensorimotor adaptation, impaired DVA, and gaze control as observed in astronauts upon their return to Earth {1}. Previous research has used 0.5x lenses to simulate the decreased DVA experienced by a returning astronaut {2}. Minifying lenses cause visual inputs to move less than normal, which creates visual-vestibular conflict and can impair DVA. Our study reports the novel development and use of head-mounted, extended reality to simulate decreased DVA from G-transitions. We developed and tested this minifying lens effect with 5 healthy subjects (best correctable visual acuity of 20/20). The level of minimization was decreased in a stepwise manner from: normal, 30% smaller, 50% smaller, 70% smaller, 80% smaller. Measured DVAs were 0.485; 0.525; 0.695; 0.655; 0.855 LogMAR respectively, showing a decreased DVA as the level of minimization increased. There are currently no DVA assessment techniques in microgravity, which is why DVA and vestibular adaptations in space are poorly understood. Our group aims to address this crucial knowledge gap by developing a head-mounted visual assessment system that can measure DVA and highlight the potential of using extended reality-based minifying lenses to study vestibular dysfunction in both space and terrestrial settings {3}.","NASA Grant [80NSSC20K183]: A Non-intrusive Ocular Monitoring Framework to Model Ocular Structure and Functional Changes due to Long-term Spaceflight.",Waisberg,Ethan,"University College Dublin School of Medicine, Belfield, Dublin, Ireland",Ong,Joshua,"Michigan Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States",Zaman,Nasif,"Human-Machine Perception Laboratory, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Nevada, Reno, Reno, Nevada, United States",Kamran,"Sharif Amit","Human-Machine Perception Laboratory, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Nevada, Reno, Reno, Nevada, United States",Lee,"Andrew G.","Department of Ophthalmology, Blanton Eye Institute, Houston Methodist Hospital, Houston, Texas, United States + Center for Space Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States + The Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston Methodist Hospital, Houston, Texas, United States + Departments of Ophthalmology, Neurology, and Neurosurgery, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, United States + Department of Ophthalmology, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, United States + University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States + Texas A&M College of Medicine, Texas, United States + Department of Ophthalmology, The University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, Iowa City, Iowa, United States",Tavakkoli,Alireza,"Human-Machine Perception Laboratory, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Nevada, Reno, Reno, Nevada, United States",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Though it is common to use pupil size as a measure of other operator-state parameters such as cognitive workload or stress, its role in the visual system can complicate this. It may be more useful to assess dynamic, rapid changes in pupil size in response to workload or stress related events. Here, we measured pupil size velocity in 14 participants who were engaged in an aerial refueling simulation on a 3D display. Refueling collisions (when the fuel nozzle hits the receiver aircraft outside of the refueling receptacle) were recorded, and the pupil velocity at all time-points 10 seconds prior and 10 seconds post-collision were averaged to calculate the event-related change in pupil velocity. On average, there was a -0.49 mm/sec spike in pupil velocity that began 0.39 seconds after the collision and lasted 1.62 seconds before returning to stasis. This suggests that the collision caused a rapid pupil constriction, indicating a stress related change. Approximately 2 seconds post-collision, the pupil began to drift back toward its static state, showing a quick return to its role in promoting good image quality. These data represent a novel way of considering the pupil in the context of its many influences and suggests that rapid spikes in pupil size may indicate an increase in operator stress.","FA2396-22-F-0137 and FA8075-16-D-0010",O'Keefe,Eleanor,"KBR, inc.",Winterbottom,Marc,"711th Human Performance Wing, United States Air Force",Hadley,Steven,"711th Human Performance Wing, United States Air Force",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In our case the stimulus dimension corresponded to the slope of the image amplitude spectrum. Grayscale noise images were filtered to form a range of slopes from 0 to -2 in steps of 0.2. Further image arrays were generated by first binarizing the image intensities and then extracting only the edges to isolate the fractal structure (corresponding to fractal dimension range from 1 to 2 in steps of 0.1). For each array the MLDS task was used to estimate the perceived differences. Scaling for fractal dimension did not differentially favor natural fractal values.

In this study, we measured perceptual scales for achromatic contrast with Maximum Likelihood Difference Scaling (MLDS), using squares against a mid-grey background. Observers compared two stimulus pairs and chose the more different pair. All four squares were either achromatic increments (A+), or achromatic decrements (A-). The MLDS result was then compared with 2AFC achromatic pedestal discrimination, with pedestals and tests that were all combinations of A+ and A-. The main result is not novel: A+ and A- obey different rules. A Naka-Rushton saturating function describes the A+ MLDS result well, and the derivative of that function is proportional to the A+ pedestal discrimination for some (but not all) observers. A- MLDS and discrimination results are more complicated and are reminiscent of the classic findings of Whittle (1986, 1992). The sensitivity of A- is a cubic polynomial function of pedestal contrast. These findings will be compared with a similar study of S-cone contrast (reported at VSS 2022), which found a different type of asymmetry between S+ and S-. Presumably these increment/decrement asymmetries are due to underlying differences between ON and OFF neural pathways. One implication is that using stimuli that include both contrast signs, such as gratings and flicker, may obscure important asymmetries in the processing of contrast."," NSF BCS-1921771",Eskew,Rhea,"Northeastern University",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Retinal illuminance of the background may be varied in three ways: (a) varying the mean current supplied to the LEDs from the controller (adjustable in software); (b) using calibrated neutral density filters mounted near the eye; and (c) changing the midpoint of the RGB channels in software (e.g., making the white background as R=G=B=0.1 instead of 0.5). Method (c) is made easier by the fact that the PROPixx “gamma curve” is linear, which also means that no RGB bits are lost to gamma correction. We will show thresholds for achromatic tests on a white background varying from 0.56 to 4.03 log trolands, with preliminary results suggesting differences in the tvi curves between the increment and decrement tests.","This work was supported by NSF BCS-1921771","Eskew, Jr.","Rhea T.","Northeastern University, Boston, MA",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we characterized the elastic properties of sclera using an air-coupled ultrasonic (ACUS) optical coherence elastography (OCE) system. New Zealand rabbit eyes (n=7) were measured (<24hr postmortem) in four scleral locations: superior/inferior temporal (ST, IT), and superior/inferior nasal (SN, IN) maintaining an intraocular pressure of 15 mmHg. Elastic waves were induced in the sclera, and wave propagation velocity and shear modulus were measured along two directions: circumferential (superior-inferior) and meridional (nasal-temporal). Wave velocity in scleral tissue ranged from 6 to 24 m/s and shear modulus from 11 to 150 kPa. Velocity was significantly higher (p<.001) in the circumferential vs. meridional directions in the following locations: ST:15.83±2.85 vs 9.43±1.68 m/s, IT:15.00±3.98 vs 8.93±1.53 m/s; SN:16.79±4.30 vs 9.27±1.47 m/s; and IN:13.92±3.85 vs 8.57±1.46 m/s. The average shear modulus in the circumferential was also significantly higher (p<.001) than in the meridional direction for all locations: 65.37±6.04 vs 22.55±1.36 kPa. These results show that the rabbit sclera is mechanically anisotropic with higher rigidity in the circumferential direction compared to the meridional direction. ACUS-OCE is a promising non-invasive method to quantify the biomechanical changes in scleral tissue for future studies involving myopia treatments.","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme European Project Imcustomeye (H2020-ICT-2017 Ref. 779960); European Research Council (2018-ADG-SILKEYE-833106); Spanish Government PID2020-115191RB-I00; NIH NIE P30EY 001319; Unrestricted Funds Research to Prevent Blindness, NY; Spanish Government10.13039/100014440 (CSIC JAE Intro Fellowship); L'Oréal-UNESCO “For Women in Science” Spain; Spanish Government Juan de la Cierva-Incorporation Fellowship (IJC2018-037508-I); Fundacja na rzecz Nauki Polskiej (MAB/2019/12); National Agency for Academic Exchange, Polish Government (NAWA ULAM/2020/1/00176) ",Zvietcovich,Fernando,"“Daza de Valdes” Institute of Optics, The Spanish National Research Council - CSIC, Madrid, Spain",Varea,Alejandra,"“Daza de Valdes” Institute of Optics, The Spanish National Research Council - CSIC, Madrid, Spain",Curatolo,Andrea,"“Daza de Valdes” Institute of Optics, The Spanish National Research Council - CSIC, Madrid, Spain",Birkenfeld,"Judith S.","“Daza de Valdes” Institute of Optics, The Spanish National Research Council - CSIC, Madrid, Spain",Marcos,Susana,"The Center for Visual Science, University of Rochester, Rochester, New York, USA",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The stimuli were 173 patches of colors lying within the Practical Color Co-ordinate System (PCCS). The backgrounds were three achromatic colors: white, mid-gray, and black. Each color patch was pasted on mounts colored each of the background colors, making 519 combinations. Participants evaluated the stimuli on scales of bright to dark (brightness) and vivid to dull (vividness) using the Visual Analog Scale app on an iPad. They viewed the stimuli in a D65 standard light source booth in a dark room. The brightness and vividness scores for the three background colors were compared using Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons for each color. It was found that, for both brightness and vividness scores, there were considerably smaller differences between a white and a black background than between a black and a gray background or a white and a gray background. Color bias was shown, with significant differences arising compared to the PCCS tone. Brightness and vividness evaluations were correlated; thus, they were integrated using Principal Component Analysis. The loading of the first principal component was 0.826, and this new integrated dimension was termed “Brilliantness.”",None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From the acquired volumes, we extract the changes in optical path length (OPL) between the inner and outer photoreceptor junction (ISOS) and the cone outer segment tips (COST). We perform the measurements for frequencies ranging from 5 Hz to 50 Hz. The chirped flickering facilitates significantly shorter data acquisition time.

It's important to understand how this process unfolds. Recent psychophysical data indicates that the visual system extracts motion axis information faster than motion direction information (Kwon et al., 2015, J Vision). To understand the underlying mechanisms, we developed a biophysically realistic cortical network model of decision making. We generalized the two-variable reduced spiking neural network (Wong et al., 2006, J Neuroscience) to four-variable. The network input is based on motion energy (Adelson et al., 1985, Josa a) and the temporal profile of surround influence (Tadin et al., 2006, J Neuroscience). The model reproduces the prior experimental findings, showing the motion axis extraction before direction extraction. It reveals a stronger axis-wise inhibitory connection between the selective neural populations than the direction-wise inhibitory connection. We further designed a recurrent deep neural network to validate the neural population connectivity pattern. Our model provides a quantitative explanation for the temporal evolution of motion direction judgments. The results show that the spatiotemporal filtering for visual motion integration, the center-surround antagonism, and stronger axis-wise inhibitory connection between the selective neural populations can explain how the visual system can extract motion axis orientation before detecting motion direction.",None,Kwon,"Oh-Sang ","Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology",Zhang,Ruyuan,"Shanghai Jiao Tong University",Tadin,Duje,"University of Rochester ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,10,48,78,"Contributed Poster","A Simple Method for the Measurement of the Color Matching Functions",Yamauchi,Yasuki,"Yamagata University","It is well known that colorimetric matching of colors on different media does not ensure that their appearance is the same for everyone. One of the reasons is that there are variations in the color matching functions (CMFs) between observers, and that individual CMFs are different from that of the standard observer defined in CIE. If CMFs can be measured easily for each observer, customized color management will be possible. Traditional methods require the adjustment of the intensities of three primary lamps (R, G, B) which is not easy for naïve observers.
A simple method is proposed in this research, in which observers select the closest color from multiple candidates to a reference. The candidate colors are composed of 5 x 5 x 5 lattice, whose center is the expected matching color.
 The average and standard deviation of the CMFs were calculated based on the CMFs of 11 observers. For each CMF, 5 candidate values were produced: average, average +/- 1/2 SD, average +/- SD. In the experiment, the observers were allowed to choose one for each CMF of RGB among 5 candidates to make a best match. Five observers whose CMFs were measured with the adjustment method participated in the experiment. The results of two methods showed good consistencies for the G and R CMFs, while some discrepancies were observed for the B CMFs. The total time of the experiment was reduced to 1/4 to 1/3, and it was also easy for the naïve subjects, which indicate that our method is an effective one.","This work was partially supported by JSPS KAKENHI (C) Grant Number 20K12017",Kamimura,Yuki,"Yamagata University",Liu,Ruiyan,"Yamagata University",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

",Yang,Jingyi,"University of Rochester","Attesting to the relative strength of retinal inputs to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus, in cats, acute retinal lesions erase responses of LGN neurons whose receptive fields fall within the retinal lesion projection zone (LPZ). Yet, thirty days later, these receptive fields appear to shift their representation to the immediate surround of the LPZ. However, little is known about whether LGN neurons in parallel streams are equally affected following retinal damage. Here, we asked whether changes in response properties of surviving LGN neurons depend on (1) their identity as either X/Y or ON/OFF cells, or (2) their receptive fields’ positions relative to the LPZ. To test these hypotheses, we made retinal lesions by injecting kainic acid (KA) into one eye of ferrets and recorded from LGN neurons bilaterally in response to visual stimuli 7 days post-lesion. Area and eccentricities of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss in the retina were measured by RBPMS immunostaining. Relative eccentricities of recorded LGN neurons were based on electrode tracts. Our preliminary data suggest that RGC with large cell bodies are preserved in the lesioned eye. Additionally, we observed normal transient responses but altered sustained responses to flashing stimuli among contralateral responsive OFF LGN neurons. Together, these findings support the notion that acute KA lesions may differentially impact visual parallel processing streams at the surround of the LPZ in the LGN.",EY031520,Huxlin,Krystel,"University of Rochester",Briggs,Farran,"University of Rochester",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An early validation study was conducted with 5 subjects comparing our novel assessment with a traditional laptop-based test. All participants had a best correctable visual acuity of 20/20, had no past ocular history, balancing disorders, or neurological history. Our DVA assessment framework was built in UnrealEngine 4. The early validation study confirmed that our VR-based DVA assessment performed similarly to traditional laptop-based test (0.485 and 0.525 LogMar respectively, Pearson Correlation = 0.911). A Bland-Altman plot and analysis demonstrated that our DVA assessment data fell within the upper and lower limits of agreement.

The model was designed for vessel object detection, using a Deep Neural Network (DNN), for scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO) retinal images. Image embedding vectors were used to proactively select the most informative data. We established a baseline of k-fold cross validation frameworks to measure model performance, where 809 annotated images were randomly selected from our database and divided into multiple regions of interest with minimal selection bias. Using this validation framework, we observed the detection model for vessel junctions could achieve a mean average precision (mAP) of 0.648, precision of 0.645, and recall of 0.703; tested on 135 images. We then tested our active learning system by dividing the dataset into two clusters using image embedding vectors and machine learning clustering algorithms.

As for M (Mean sphere equivalent), it can achieve -11.85D-+10.88D at 0° visual field and -6.97D-+5.88D at 30° visual field with a 4mm pupil size. To allow a changing pupil size, a slot at the back of the cornea mount and a series of thin metal sheets with 2, 3, 4, and 6 mm holes are manufactured.

However, the means by which the eye determines whether light is focused in front of, or behind the retina, remains elusive. In the current study, we propose a new cue for the sign of defocus: the orientation of the anisotropic peripheral blur. Previously published [1] population averages of wavefront aberrations across the horizontal visual field in hyperopes, emmetropes and myopes were used to assess peripheral optical quality and blur orientation. Due to the large magnitudes of off-axis astigmatism and coma, the peripheral retinal image quality was dominated by anisotropic blur, whose direction was also correlated with refractive error (vertically elongated peripheral blur in myopic eyes and horizontally elongated peripheral blur in emmetropic and hyperopic eyes). The differences in groups may be due to the interaction between peripheral wavefront aberrations and globe shape (i.e. peripheral axial length). We also found an interaction between longitudinal chromatic aberration and off-axis astigmatism, wherein peripheral blur orientation is wavelength dependent, raising additional questions pertaining to the nature of chromatic cues. The orientation of peripheral blur may provide the retina with an optical cue for the sign of defocus, potentially playing an important role in emmetropization.

This is true for both active touch—when a person moves to touch an object—and passive touch—when an object moves to touch a person. However, limited research has been conducted on how active and passive touch are processed by the cortex, as well as how prediction of the sensory experience influences that processing. Here, we use electroencephalography (EEG) to measure cortical activity while virtual reality creates the visual expectation of touching an object that is paired with vibrotactile feedback. In the active condition, the participant will reach toward and receive tactile input from the virtual object. In the passive condition, the virtual object will move toward and provide tactile input to the participant. This experiment will measure an electrophysiological phenomenon called the mismatch negativity (MMN), a distinct deflection in the EEG waveform shown to index a deviation from an established pattern in sensory stimuli. To elicit an MMN, we will manipulate the duration of the vibrotactile stimuli, with 80% being 100 ms long and 20% being 160 ms long. Our experiment is the first to assess the MMN in an active tactile context. Preliminary data (n=4) show a robust N1 component and MMN in response to active and passive touch.
