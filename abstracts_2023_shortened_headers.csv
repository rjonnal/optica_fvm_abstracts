Their success can be judged by how well they predict those human judgements, by how broad the range of conditions they encompass, and possibly by how well their internals match the neurophysiology. Tangentially, they may be judged by how useful they are in practical applications.

Here, I will describe our recent efforts to understand how intrinsic fluctuations in the ratio of excitatory to inhibitory conductances play out in space and time, and how these fluctuations impact perception. We find that spontaneous cortical activity is organized into traveling waves that traverse visual cortex several times per second. Recording in Area MT of the common marmoset, we find that these intrinsic traveling waves (iTWs) regulate both the gain of the stimulus-evoked spiking response and the monkey’s perceptual sensitivity. A large-scale spiking network model recapitulates the properties of iTWs measured in vivo and explains the observed fluctuations in response gain as resulting from momentary fluctuations in E/I balance.  The model predicts that iTWs are sparse, in the sense that only a small fraction of the neural population participates in any individual iTW. As a result, iTWs can occur without inducing correlated variability, which we have found, in separate experiments, can impair sensory discrimination. We thus refer to the model as the sparse-wave model of iTWs. Taken together, these findings lead to the conclusion that traveling waves strongly modulate neural and perceptual sensitivity.

Our model emulates sensory encoding to segment figures from their background and predict performance. To explain attentional effects, exogenous and endogenous attention require separate operating regimes across spatial frequency. The model reproduces behavioral performance across several experiments and resolves three unexplained phenomena: 1) the parafoveal advantage in segmentation, 2) the uniform improvements across eccentricity by endogenous attention, and 3) the peripheral improvements and central impairments by exogenous attention.

The stimulus in each eye flickered with a unique temporal frequency, which allowed us to “frequency-tag” the responses to each eye’s input (self  terms) as well as the responses to the combination of inputs from the two eyes (intermodulation terms). We measured two forms of binocular interaction: one associated with the suppressive effect of one eye’s stimulus on the other, and the other associated with a direct measure of interocular interaction between the two eyes’ inputs. Fits of a contrast gain control model to the data demonstrated that a common gain control mechanism is consistent with both forms of binocular interaction.  We then used the contrast normalization framework to investigate the disruptions to binocular interaction in amblyopia.  Although anisometropic amblyopes showed a similar pattern of responses to normal-vision observers, strabismic amblyopes exhibited both reduced responses to the amblyopic eye stimulus in the presence of a mask in the other eye, as well as substantially reduced intermodulation responses indicating reduced interocular interactions in visual cortex. A contrast normalization model that simultaneously fit self- and IM-term responses showed that the excitatory contribution to binocular interaction is significantly reduced in strabismic amblyopia.

Exponentiation favors the strong. Larger responses grow even larger than smaller ones. In the extreme, exponentiation is a winner-take-all computation. Division by the pooled responses of a neural population brings run-away responses back down to an operable range. Division normalizes to the average population activity responses that have grown large through exponentiation. Such simple operations have surprisingly many applications across sensory and cognitive systems of the brain.

Majority of ORG implementations employ adaptive optics (AO) for imaging activity at a cellular scale. Coarse-scale Optoretinography (CoORG), an ORG paradigm without AO, offers rapid, extended-field recordings and wider applicability in patients with retinal disease, by compromising cellular resolution. This study investigates the feasibility of CoORG in assessing cone dysfunction in patients diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Five RP patients aged 26 – 60 were recruited, alongside age-similar controls. The stimulus for evoking cone activity had a photon density between 15.5x10e6 - 19.7x10e6 photons/μm2, and was centered at 532 ± 5nm. Eight imaging trials per bleach were performed, allowing for 1 min. between successive trials for dark adaptation. The total experimental time for each bleach was 10-20 mins.  In RP, cone function, estimated as the change in optical path length in the outer segment in response to a stimulus, was diminished and generally lower than normal controls. This deficit was observed in areas of seemingly normal outer retinal structure. Contrary to normals, no correlation was observed between outer segment length and cone function in RP. This highlights CoORG's potential for early, sensitive detection of retinal dysfunction prior to apparent structural degradation.","NIH grants U01EY032055, EY029710, P30EY001730, Burroughs Wellcome Fund Careers at the Scientific Interfaces,  Foundation for Fighting Blindness, Unrestricted grant from the Research to Prevent Blindness",Talk preferred,Yes (all student / postdoc trainees are eligible),Pandiyan,Vimal Prabhu,"Department of Ophthalmology, University of Washington",Wendel,Benjamin,"Department of Ophthalmology, University of Washington",Slezak,Emily,"Department of Ophthalmology, University of Washington",Mustafi,Debarshi,"Department of Ophthalmology, University of Washington; Seattle Children’s Hospital",Yes - Add additional authors,Chao,Jennifer,"Department of Ophthalmology, University of Washington",Sabesan,Ramkumar,"Department of Ophthalmology, University of Washington",,,,,,,,,,No - Submit abstract,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, functional recording has been limited to transduced RGCs close to the foveal pit.  In this study we evaluate ILM peel as a strategy to expand the area of transduced RGCs and allow functional recording beyond the fovea in the living eye. 4 eyes of 3 immunosuppressed macaca fascicularis received a 9-12° ILM peel centered on the fovea, followed by intravitreal injection of GCaMP8s 4-8 weeks post-peel. A 660nm flickering visual stimulus drove RGC GCaMP responses which were recorded with fluorescence adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscopy. In all eyes GCaMP was expressed throughout the peeled area, representing a mean 8-fold enlargement in the area of expression relative to a control eye with no peel.  Functional responses were obtained from RGCs at max eccentricities of 11.7 o, 8.0 o, 9.7 o, and 13.7 o and could be classified as ON or OFF types up to the edge of the peel. Mean RGC responses in ILM peeled and control eyes of the same animal were comparable at 3.5 o and longitudinal tracking of individual RGCs showed stable responses up to 6 months post-peel. ILM peel substantially expands the region of primate retina accessible for in vivo GCaMP beyond the foveal ring of RGCs. This presents new opportunities for physiological study of the retina and pre-clinical testing of novel therapies in retinal degeneration models.","Research reported in this publication was supported by the National Eye Institute of the National Institutes of Health under Audacious Goals Initiative funding Award No. York U24 EY033275 Accelerating photoreceptor replacement therapy with in-vivo cellular imaging of retinal function in primate, P30 EY001319 (core) and F32 EY032318 Foveal ganglion cell function in the living eye.

Animal models suggest that these proteins have lower sensitivity, and slower kinetics compared to neurotypical vision. Here we describe a framework for simulating ‘virtual patients’ to quantify the predicted perceptual experience of optogenetic vision. We simulated the neural responses of rd1 mouse retina expressing 4xBGAG12,460:SNAP-mGluR2 (Holt et al., 2022) and used this simulation to generate virtual patients: sighted participants viewing the visual stimulus filtered through our simulations. We measured the visual performance of these virtual patients (n=6) using temporal contrast sensitivity functions. Virtual patients had a 10x fold loss of sensitivity, which was exacerbated at higher temporal frequencies, corresponding to a loss of Snellen acuity from ~20/40 at low temporal frequencies to ~20/100-20/200 at high temporal frequencies. We predict that the ability to process fast-moving objects may be impaired in optogenetic vision, and patients with uncontrollable nystagmus may be poor candidates for optogenetic treatments with sluggish kinetics. Our virtual patient framework can easily be extended to simulate any optogenetic protein, and thereby provides a way to quantify and compare the expected perceptual performance of different opto-proteins based on in vitro retinal data.

Retinal image minification, for example, is caused by myopic spectacle correction and may also occur in near-eye displays. Previous work suggests that different amounts of minification (or magnification) between the eyes can produce perceptual distortions and oculomotor discomfort, but the extent to which these effects are problematic is unknown. In our first study, forty observers wore minifying spectacles of 2% or 4% in both eyes (binocular), just one eye (monocular), or neither eye (control). After performing a task that incorporated reading, interacting with objects, and visual search, participants reported their symptoms. Overall, participants found monocular minification to be slightly more uncomfortable than the binocular counterpart. Monocular minification produced greater eyestrain and self-reported difficulty interacting with objects. In a second study, we investigated how these two symptoms change after one hour of adaptation to monocular 4% lenses. We found that both symptoms worsened during adaptation. Interestly, the difficulty interacting with objects declined soon after the lenses were removed, while eyestrain persisted.

To establish the link between glaucoma, the most prevalent cause of irreversible blindness, and changes in major brain connections, we characterized white matter tissue properties in diffusion MRI measurements in a large sample of subjects with glaucoma (N=905; age 49-80) and healthy controls (N=5,292; age 45-80) from the UK Biobank. Confounds due to group differences were mitigated by matching a sub-sample of controls to glaucoma subjects. A convolutional neural network (CNN) accurately classified whether a subject has glaucoma using information from the primary visual connection to cortex (the optic radiations, OR), but not from non-visual brain connections. On the other hand, regularized linear regression could not classify glaucoma, and the CNN did not generalize to classification of age-group or of age-related macular degeneration. This suggests a unique non-linear signature of glaucoma in OR tissue properties.","This project was funded by NSF grant 1934292 (PI: Balazinska), NIH grant R01 AG 060942 (PI: Lee), NEI grant R01 EY033628 (PI: Benson), NIH grant RF1 MH121868 (PI: Rokem), NIH grant R01HD095861 (PI: Yeatman).

These findings suggest that conventional diagnostics can be insensitive to cone loss below a threshold and/or that visual circuits can be resilient to cone loss up to a threshold. To distinguish between these possibilities, our lab studied the effects of partial cone loss in the mature mouse retina. We induced controlled cone loss by selectively expressing the diphtheria toxin receptor under the cone opsin promoter (cone-DTR). We examined the effects of 50% cone loss on the three of the most sensitive cell types in mouse retina: alpha ON sustained (AON-S), OFF sustained (AOFF-S), and OFF transient (AOFF-T) ganglion cells. With multiple cell types, we can discern between effects common across pathways, i.e., changes to common circuit components, and effects unique to pathways, i.e., changes to circuit components after the pathways diverge to each cell type. In AON-S ganglion cells, partial cone loss triggers inhibition to increase spatiotemporal integration, recover contrast gain, and receive increased synaptic inputs. While OFF pathways also exhibit modified spatiotemporal processing with fewer cones, the extent of functional adjustments was unique between the AOFF-S and AOFF-T. Cone loss caused differential modifications to inhibition in each of these retinal pathways.

Here, I will present our work on a more detailed assessment of photoreceptor and RPE single cell suspension transplantations. Human photoreceptors incorporate extensively into a cone-degeneration mouse host, interact with host Müller glia and bipolar cells and polarize to form inner and outer segments as well as synapses. Importantly, increased donor-host interactions correlate with improved graft polarization and maturation, with donor cell age greatly influencing this process. Similarly, RPE transplantations into an acute RPE depletion mouse model showed that monolayer formation strongly depends on RPE differentiation times, with further improvement by enrichment of an RPE subpopulation by cell surface markers.

Here, each unit, or ommatidium, acts as an independent visual detector, with its own corneal lens, internal optics, and set of photoreceptors.  Ommatidia tuned to different wavelengths can be individually placed in the eye to build unusual color systems.  In mantis shrimps, the receptors responsible for color vision are limited to six parallel rows of ommatidia that together form an equatorial belt, called the midband.  Various receptors in these ommatidia are tuned to eight narrow-band spectral channels in the visible spectrum plus up to four additional ultraviolet channels.  Thus, there is a total of twelve different color receptors for color vision.  How these color channels are analyzed in the complex set of optic lobes existing behind the retina is only partly understood.  It appears that stomatopods use both opponent and labelled-line color channels.  Oddly, these animals appear to have limited ability to discriminate between spectral lights, but they have outstanding color constancy.  Color vision, and color processing, in stomatopods is probably unlike that of any other animal group.",,I was asked to submit an abstract for an Invited or Award Lecture,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,No - Submit abstract,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We therefore asked whether fine-scale synaptic wiring in the nervous system is preserved across these three primate families, despite long periods of independent evolution. We applied connectomic electron microscopy to the specialized foveal retina where circuits for highest acuity and color vision reside. Synaptic motifs arising from the cone photoreceptor type sensitive to short (S) wavelengths and associated with “blue–yellow” (S-ON and S-OFF) color-coding circuitry were reconstructed. We found that distinctive circuitry arises from S cones for each of the three species. The S cones contacted neighboring L and M (long- and middle-wavelength sensitive) cones in humans, but such contacts were rare or absent in macaques and marmosets. We discovered a major S-OFF pathway in the human retina and established its absence in marmosets. Further, the S-ON and S-OFF chromatic pathways make excitatory-type synaptic contacts with L and M cone types in humans, but not in macaques or marmosets. Our results predict that early-stage chromatic signals are distinct in the human retina and imply that solving the human connectome at the nanoscale level of synaptic wiring will be critical for fully understanding the neural basis of human color vision.",NIH grant EY-028282,I was asked to submit an abstract for an Invited or Award Lecture,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,No - Submit abstract,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How retinal circuits extract relevant visual information is a major area of inquiry. In the mouse retina, cone photoreceptors possess a gradient of opsin expression leading to uneven detection of colors across visual space. However, at the output of the retina, ganglion cells' color preferences deviate from this gradient, suggesting that circuits in the retina may alter the color information before sending it to the brain. We explored how circuits in the retina shape chromatic information, focusing on the retina's interneurons, amacrine cells and bipolar cells. We found that inhibitory amacrine cells rebalance color preferences, leading to diverse color selectivity throughout retinal space. Since amacrine cells vary widely across species, these cells are poised to tune the chromatic information sent to the brain to each species' environmental niche.","German Research Foundation (DFG; BE5601/2-1; SPP 2041; BE5601/4-1,2; EU42/9-1,2), the German Ministry of Education and Research (Bernstein Award 01GQ1601 to PB; BCCN 01GQ1002 to KF), the Medical Faculty/U Tübingen (fortüne to AV), and the Max Planck Society (M.FE.A.KYBE0004 to KF).",I was asked to submit an abstract for an Invited or Award Lecture,Yes (all student / postdoc trainees are eligible),Korympidou,Maria M,"Institute for Ophthalmic Research, University of Tuebingen",Strauss,Sarah,"Institute for Ophthalmic Research, University of Tuebingen",Schubert,Timm,"Institute for Ophthalmic Research, University of Tuebingen",Franke,Katrin,Baylor College of Medicine,Yes - Add additional authors,Berens,Philipp,"Tuebingen AI Center, Institute for Ophthalmic Research, University of Tuebingen",Euler,Thomas,"Institute for Ophthalmic Research, Werner Reichardt Centre for Integrative Neuroscience, University of Tuebingen",,,,,,,,,,No - Submit abstract,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we present an analysis of saccadic landing behavior under these conditions. We used an adaptive optics ophthalmoscope to record retinal videos while subjects (N = 6) made small saccades to a tumbling-E stimulus that appeared at random loci within a 3x3 square grid with 0.5° spacing. Subjects reported stimulus orientation via keypress, after which the target moved to a new location. Retinal videos recorded during each experiment were used to extract eye position traces and localize stimuli in retinal coordinates. Saccade PRLs were computed from the post-saccadic retinal landing positions using the ISOA method. The mean (± SEM) saccade PRL areas were 122 ± 8.1 arcmin2 and 525 ± 133 arcmin2 for the L/M- and S-cone conditions, respectively (p<0.01; Wilcoxon rank-sum test). For both conditions, the post-saccadic ISOA size reduced over the course of ~300 ms.

There were large differences in overall sensitivity across individuals, but the time-course of performance change with ISI was similar across participants. Thresholds for ISI=33 ms were close to performance with two consecutive frames, suggesting complete summation of light energy; whereas thresholds for ISI=300 ms were closer to the single-frame case, suggesting limited summation; and thresholds for ISI=100 ms were intermediate, suggesting residual summation. The effect of ISI on threshold was similar for stabilised stimuli and natural viewing, but there was a small trend towards lower thresholds for stabilised stimuli at short ISI and vice-versa at long ISI.

This visuomotor response is called accommodation. For a given accommodative state, light at only one wavelength can be in focus because the eye contains significant chromatic aberration. We examined how the visual system weights different wavelengths for focusing polychromatic stimuli, especially those with peaks at more than one wavelength. With an autorefractor, we continuously measured human accommodative responses (at 30 Hz) to stimuli comprising various mixtures of short- and long-wavelength content. In a series of trials, seven human observers viewed a three-letter word stimulus spanning 1.5° (24 arcmins per letter) against a black background on an AMOLED display for seven seconds. The optical distance of the screen was varied using a focus-adjustable lens. Halfway through the trial, the stimulus underwent a step change in optical distance (±0.75, 1.00, or 1.50 diopters). Simultaneously, the color of the stimulus changed. Accommodative responses for each subject were analyzed with nested descriptive models, including a color-free model, a weighted-averaging model, and a color-switching model. The results show that stimulus color significantly influences the dynamic accommodative response, and that long wavelengths influence the response more than short wavelengths, even when their luminance is the same.

We measured changes in pupil size in 48 participants using a binocular eye-tracker, targeting specific photoreceptor classes with a binocular 10-primary light engine and the silent substitution method.

However, a recent adaptive-optics-based study by Boehm et al. reveals that when stimulus size is reduced to a few arcmin, color appearance depends on the local L:M proportion in the patch of the retina on which the stimulus was imaged. We aimed to determine if such findings are consistent with a normative account of visual processing. A series of 3.5 and 10 arcmin stimuli were simulated as isoluminant mixtures of 540 and 680 nm primaries. We modeled sensory encoding under adaptive-optics conditions using the open-source software ISETBio, for simulated retinal cone mosaics with varying local L:M proportions. The resultant cone excitations were decoded using a Bayesian image reconstruction algorithm (Zhang et al., 2022). For the 3.5 arcmin stimuli, as local L:M proportion decreased, the 540 nm component of the reconstructions increased relative to the 680 nm component. This is qualitatively consistent with the experimental observations of Boehm et al.  For 10 arcmin stimuli, in contrast, reconstructions were stable across variation in local L:M cone proportion. Notably, reconstructions depend not only on the local L:M cone proportion, but also on the proportion in the immediately surrounding retina, leading to a testable prediction. The computational observations frame the experimental results as a normative consequence of visual processing.","The University of Pennsylvania Post-Baccalaureate Research Education Program, grant number R25 GM071745, and a research gift from Meta",No preference,Yes (all student / postdoc trainees are eligible),Zhang,Ling-Qi,University of Pennsylvania,Boehm,Alexandra E. ,"Herbert Wertheim School of Optometry & Vision Science, University of California, Berkeley",Greene,Maxwell J. ,"Herbert Wertheim School of Optometry & Vision Science, University of California, Berkeley",Tuten,William S. ,"Herbert Wertheim School of Optometry & Vision Science, University of California, Berkeley",Yes - Add additional authors,Brainard,David H.,University of Pennsylvania,,,,,,,,,,,,,No - Submit abstract,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For example, participants can detect colors in two locations as well as in one, but can recognize only one masked word at a time (White, Palmer, & Boynton, Psych Science 2018). Here, we ask whether judging objects with interchangeable parts, similar to letters in words, also produces performance deficits consistent with serial processing, and which brain areas subserve this process. In a probe recognition task, participants discriminated abstract objects made of Duplo™ parts. On each trial, two objects were presented, with either one or both objects cued as relevant (single- and dual-task conditions, respectively). The distractor probes were made of the same parts in a different order. The difference in performance between the single- and dual-task conditions was 17±1% (n=13), consistent with the prediction of a serial model and rejecting the fixed-capacity parallel model. This result suggests that there is a visual brain area where information can be processed about only one object at a time. Currently, we are using fMRI to examine activity in object-selective regions of the human lateral occipital cortex.

The proposed computational theory differs from the current mainstream approaches to the problem in two fundamentally different ways.  First, it assumes that 3D mechanisms are deterministic processes that map a given visual stimulus to a unique 3D representation. Second, the proposed theory posits that 3D processing is heuristic, finding correct solutions to the problem only in ideal viewing conditions. The deterministic and heuristic nature of these mechanisms is inconsistent with Bayesian approaches that model brain mechanisms as processes of Bayesian inference aimed at deriving the most accurate and precise representation of 3D structures. These two main features of the proposed theory are implemented in a computational model that allows quantitative predictions of new phenomena. First, it provides an entirely different interpretation of Just Noticeable Differences, a hallmark measure of perceptual uncertainty. Second, it predicts specific perceptual distortions that are at odds with what previous accounts would predict.

Healthy binocular vision is exquisite, which is achieved though interactions among various visual subsystems. As a result, however, binocular vision has multiple points of weakness, so development can go wrong in many different ways. Furthermore, the visual system has many ways it can adapt to dysfunctions to improve vision. It is therefore not surprising that amblyopias are idiosyncratic from one person to the next. Habitual interocular suppression is a typical adaption in amblyopia, and by treating suppression in VR, acuity can be improved by 0.1 to 0.2 logMAR. However, the amblyopic visual system shows complicated patterns of interaction between suppression, acuity, stereopsis, motor vergence, accommodation, and motion perception; and each of those subsystems is itself complex. Thus, to improve acuity and stereopsis in amblyopia, a multifaceted approach would seem more promising.

But will that color term allow someone else to understand which sample was named? We examined color understanding using a Color Communication Game, in which one person (the “sender”) names 30 color samples as in any color-naming study, then another person (the “receiver”) chooses the sample they think the sender intended to communicate. The receiver cannot always guess the right sample, and no choice strategy will do better than randomly choosing among the samples the receiver called by that term. When 70 English-speaking dyads and 63 Somali-speaking dyads played the game, receivers did not perform randomly. Instead, they systematically chose “focal” samples near the centers of their color term distributions. When the senders’ named samples were compared directly to the receivers’ chosen samples, the systematic distribution of receiver choices revealed color categories, which appeared without any statistical analysis of the players’ terms. Simulation of receiver choices based on senders’ color names showed that both Somali-speaking and English-speaking participants knew more color terms than the ones they used in color-naming. Our Color Communication Game showed that color-naming experiments underestimate color understanding: people understand colors categorically, but they express colors using multiple synonymous color terms that are well-understood by others.

Methods: Infant rhesus macaques homozygous for the PDE6C R565Q mutation were generated through a breeding program at the California National Primate Research Center. Homozygotes were treated in the right eye with adeno-associated virus (AAV5) carrying rhesus PDE6C under the control of the PR1.7 cone-specific promoter. The left eye was used as a control. Animals were tested by full-field and multifocal electroretinography. A total of 7 animals have been treated. Results: The virus was found to be safe, but with variable inflammatory response. There were no obvious alterations in retinal lamination in treated eyes. The virus was expressed specifically in cone photoreceptors. Pre- and post-treatment systemic steroids led to minimal to moderate inflammatory response. In general, the gene therapy partially restored the cone responses on ERG within one month of injection in infants, but not in the older animals.

Prior work comparing S-cone isolating visual acuity (sVA) to histological estimates of S-cone density has led to mixed conclusions, likely due to inter-individual differences in the S-cone sub-mosaic. We examined sVA in subjects with spectrally classified cone mosaics to test how the grain of the S-cone sub-mosaic limits resolution. Three observers whose cones were previously classified via adaptive optics (AO)-OCT based optoretinography participated in an sVA task at eccentricities ranging from 1.3° to 12.9° spread along all four cardinal meridians. Observers adapted to yellow light [CIE (0.45, 0.51); 200 cd/m2] for two minutes.Then, acuity was measured using a Tumbling ‘E’ task that showed blue [CIE (0.16, 0.044); 0.66 cd/m2) letters on the same yellow background, with an S-cone contrast of 0.93 (L/M-cone contrasts <0.01). Simultaneously recorded high-resolution AOSLO videos helped guide stimulus delivery to the spectrally classified retinal area. Measured sVAs were worse than predicted by the calculated S-cone Nyquist limit at all eccentricities, suggesting pooling of information from S-cones. Moreover, this pooling increased with eccentricity. While sVA does not follow the S-cone Nyquist limit, it is in good concordance with the Nyquist limit corresponding to known estimates of the sampling density of small bistratified retinal ganglion cells.","NIH grants U01EY032055, EY029710, P30EY001730; Burroughs Wellcome Fund Careers at the Scientific Interfaces; DOD Air Force Office of Scientific Research FA9550-21-1-0230; Unrestricted grant from the Research to Prevent Blindness",Talk preferred,No,Slezak,Emily,"Department of Ophthalmology, University of Washington",Pandiyan,Vimal Prabhu,"Department of Ophthalmology, University of Washington",Coates,Daniel,"College of Optometry, University of Houston",Sabesan,Ramkumar,"Department of Ophthalmology, University of Washington",No - Submit abstract,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The midget pathway has been depicted as a “private” transmission line from individual cones to the brain, where the retinal image is processed. Indeed, in the primate retina, there are two midget bipolar cells devoted to each cone (Masri et al. 2020 J Neurosci 40:8132), providing two full-resolution representations of the visual image at the bipolar cell terminals. As the major carrier of signals from cones to the inner plexiform layer (IPL), the midget bipolars are positioned to transmit and receive signals from numerous neuron types. Serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (EM) was used to reconstruct ON midget bipolar cells. Outgoing ribbon synapses and incoming conventional synapses were identified using classical EM criteria. Strikingly, each bipolar cell terminal was associated with over 100 postsynaptic interactions. Contrary to the 1:1:1 pathway from cone to midget ganglion cell, each midget bipolar cell made >50 excitatory synapses onto cells other than the one midget ganglion cell it contacted, distributing signals to a dozen or more neurons. This included parasol cells, making midget bipolar signals divergent rather than parallel. Contrary to primarily functioning to transmit signals straight through to the brain, the IPL circuity is well-positioned to do much of the visual image processing before the signals arrive at the cortex.","NIH Grants, Research to Prevent Blindness, Bishop Foundation",Talk preferred,No,Bordt,Andrea,"Department of Ophthalmology, University of Washington ",Yang,Emma,"Department of Biosciences, Rice University",Kuchenbecker,James,"Department of Ophthalmology, University of Washington",Lin-Goldstein,Arie,"Department of Ophthalmology, University of Washington",Yes - Add additional authors,Rieke-Wey,Isabelle,"Department of Ophthalmology, University of Washington",Rieke-Wey,Ayden,"Department of Ophthalmology, University of Washington",Soetedjo,Christopher,"Department of Ophthalmology, University of Washington",Arriola,Rafael,"Department of Ophthalmology, University of Washington",Neitz,Maureen,"Department of Ophthalmology, University of Washington",Yes - add additional authors,Neitz,Jay,"Department of Ophthalmology, University of Washington",,,,,,,,,,,,,No - Submit abstract,

However, at high contrasts, excitation and inhibition between binocular (“Bin”) and monocular (“Mon’) responses are balanced, resulting in ocularity invariance behaviourally, and in the primary visual cortex. Little is known about whether and how signals are combined binocularly in other brain regions, including MT and some subcortical areas. We investigated whether we could measure differences in fMRI BOLD responses in Bin vs Mon across different brain regions, for high contrast luminance and chromatic stimuli. Thirty-six subjects had four functional MRI scans consisting of a block design with five stimulus types (three luminance stimuli, L-M, and S-cone) presented in Bin and Mon. Expanding ring and rotating wedge stimuli scans were also used for retinotopic mapping of the early visual areas. Full brain analyses showed greater overall responses to Bin vs Mon stimuli, centered on the occipital lobe. In individual (retinotopically-defined) ROI analyses, we saw a significant difference in beta weights between Bin and Mon conditions in V1 for luminance and L-M, but the increase in response to Bin stimuli was much lower than would be predicted by strong binocular facilitation (Quaia et al, 2019).

Using an altered reality setting, we found that this homeostatic plasticity can be triggered without depriving one eye of visual input, but merely perturbing the temporal correspondence between voluntary actions and vision in one eye. Participants wore a VR set; its monocular screens were connected with cameras monitoring the front space, which participants used to perform a complex visuomotor task. During a 60 minute period, the input to the dominant eye was delayed by 333 ms, making it useless for visuomotor coordination. Following this, ocular dominance (quantified by binocular rivalry) was systematically shifted in favour of the delayed eye, a similar effect as that produced by monocular contrast-deprivation. The shift was only observed when participants actively engaged in the visuomotor task, not when they passively watched a confederate perform the same task. We interpret these results in the light of parallel fMRI experiments where monocular deprivation is associated with a global system reconfiguration that pivots around a key area for sensorimotor integration, the Pulvinar. Based on our findings, we suggest that active vision is foundational to weighting sensory information, even at the level of simple visual processes as those setting ocular dominance.

In preparation for our first in-human TUS studies, we targeted TUS to the lateral geniculate nucleus (visual thalamus) in a large mammal (sheep).  Full-field light flash stimuli were presented with or without concomitant TUS in randomly interleaved trials. Similar to what has previously observed by Fry et al (Nature 1959) in cats, EEG visual-evoked potentials (VEPs) were reversibly suppressed by TUS to the LGN. No changes in VEPs were observed in sheep who received sham-TUS to a control site in the basal ganglia, ruling out potential transducer auditory-somatosensory confounds. Magnetic resonance acoustic radiation force imaging (MR-ARFI), a technique to measure the ultrasound focus in situ, showed a focal volume of microscopic displacement at the expected target. Excitingly, MR-ARFI predicted the suppressive effect on VEPs in individual subjects, suggesting that MR-ARFI can be used to confirm TUS targeting and estimate neurophysiological impact. We are now translating this paradigm into human, targeting TUS to the LGN while participants perform a contrast detection task with EEG recording of steady-state VEPs.

(JOSA A, 2023), in which a contrast gain control operates between the outer and inner edges of the annulus, predicts that a linear relationship should hold between the first-order (k1) and second-order coefficients (k2) of the parabolic BMFs. We previously verified this prediction and discovered that the slope of this linear relationship depends on the contrast polarity of the target with respect to its annulus, but is unaffected by the annulus size or the background luminance. Here, we further tested the model by varying the target disk luminance in two conditions where the target disk was either a decrement or an increment with respect to its annulus and the background was white (highest display luminance). The model predicts that the slope of the k1 vs k2 plots will itself decrease as a linear function of the log luminance of the target disk, and the rate of decrease will equal -1.

In multisensory integration this is the crucial Principle of Inverse Effectiveness, but here we show that inverse effectiveness also applies to some key Visual-Visual interactions.  Despite being considered one of the three most important principles in sensory integration, Inverse Effectiveness has not been properly quantified for most interactions.  For example, despite the apparent specificity of its name, there is no published evidence that enhancement drops off in a nice 1/Effectiveness progression, nor are there studies that look for an invariant form or imply a particular mechanism.  Here we address these obvious gaps by comparing data from audio-visual, audio-tactile, binocular and color vision interactions, both for psychophysical data and for neural firing rates.  The results can be predicted from a gated power law amplification (Billock & Havig, 2018) found for both psychophysical and neural enhancement data.  The Principle of Inverse Effectiveness (PIE) follows directly from the compressive exponent in the power law, and can be derived from a simulation of excitatory-synaptic-coupled Hodgkin-Huxley spiking neurons.  The similarity of inverse effectiveness in multisensory and visual-visual interactions means that multisensory researchers can have their PIE and vision researchers can eat it too.

One potential mechanism of attention is a change in the gain of sensory responses. However, changing gain at early stages could have multiple downstream consequences for visual processing. Which, if any, of these effects can account for the benefits of attention for detection and discrimination? Using a model of primate visual cortex we document how a Gaussian-shaped gain modulation results in changes to spatial tuning properties. Forcing the model to use only these changes failed to produce any benefit in task performance. Instead, we found that gain alone was both necessary and sufficient to explain category detection and discrimination during attention.

This putative effect likely originates in the melanopsin-containing intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) which project directly to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. We asked whether we could measure a direct physiological correlate of this binocular facilitation using a binocular, MRI-compatible, 10-primary spectral stimulation device. We present preliminary findings from a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study designed to explore the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response to monocular and binocular melanopic light stimulation. The study used a 30 s on/off design with three ‘ocularity’ conditions (binocular-low, monocular-high, binocular-high) and two classes of targeted photoreceptors (melanopsin and LMS cones). Throughout each scan, subjects (N=18) also responded to brief, cone-directed sinusoidal modulations of varying intensity. We report that binocular vs. monocular melanopsin stimulation induced significant BOLD activation in SCN but that this effect was not seen for cone-directed stimulation. This is consistent with the binocular facilitation effect described by Spitschan and Cajochen (2019) and provides the first direct evidence of melanopsin-driven activation and binocular facilitation in human subcortical nuclei.

This is well demonstrated by the many illusions where some surround context causes two physically identical targets to appear different in brightness (e.g. White's (1979) illusion). Here we use perceptual scales from Maximum Likelihood Conjoint Measurements to test the predictive power of computational brightness models as a function of surround context and local luminance. While the qualitative relationship between target brightness and surround context (i.e. direction of effect) is captured well by image-computable models of the spatial filtering type (e.g. Blakeslee and McCourt, 1997), these do not predict the quantitative aspects of that relationship (i.e. magnitude of effect). A different class of models (e.g. Whittle, 1992) makes quantitative predictions of brightness as a function of luminance, but requires labeling of target and background (i.e., is not image-computable), thus cannot by itself account for the spatial context. Hence we combine Whittle’s model with spatial mechanisms to account for both spatial context and local luminance. A combined model using multiscale spatial filtering and calculating brightness at every spatial scale is able to provide both a correct qualitative prediction of direction of effect, as well as a quantitative prediction of apparent brightness that can be tested against perceptual scales for different stimuli.",German Research Foundation DFG MA5127/5-1 to M.

Methods: Activity was measured from early visual cortex (V1 – V3) while participants (n = 5) viewed dichoptic gratings (2-cpd) that independently varied in contrast over time in each eye at 1/6 and 1/8 Hz. We fit a model [((L^m+R^m ))/2]^(1/m) to quantify how the neural response was driven by the contrast in each eye (L and R), where m = 1 represents simple averaging, and as m → ∞ the model shifts towards a max rule, where responses are driven by the eye presented with highest contrast.  Results: Across all visual areas, responses were much closer to a max than a mean model, suggesting that neural responses were primarily driven by the eye presented with highest contrast. Within V1, similar findings have been described using a normalization model (Moradi & Heeger, 2009). The magnitude of m increased across the visual hierarchy (V1: m = 1.82; R2 = 0.32; V2: m = 12.94, R2 = 0.28; V3: m = 13.31, R2 = 0.27).

Here we compared simultaneously-collected behavioral and EEG measures of dichoptic contrast perception. Methods: Observers (n=16) dichoptically viewed a 2-cpd grating flickering at 7.5 Hz and rotating slowly (1º/s). The contrast of the grating shown to each eye modulated sinusoidally over time at independent rates (1/6 and 1/8 Hz). We recorded EEG activity while observers positioned a joystick lever to report perceived contrast as it changed over time. Analysis: A multiband filter was used to isolate the SSVEP responses to 7.5 Hz signals from electrode Oz (occipital pole), and the standard deviation of this signal provided a measure of neural response amplitude as a function of contrast. Results: A simple model was fit to VEP and behavioral responses, [(L^m+R^m)/2]^(1/m)], which essentially characterized whether responses were better fit by a mean (m≈1) or a max (m>1) model. VEP responses (m = 1.0; MSE = 0.013) were well fit by a mean model, suggesting the EEG signal may have been driven by the input layers of V1.

If the model accurately predicts performance, then that finding is often interpreted as evidence for both components of the model. However, it is important and informative to also test heuristic decision rules. Here, we illustrate such analyses for the task of covert visual search, where a target can appear at one of n locations (or be absent) with some prior probability distribution (the “prior map”). The available sensory information can be represented by the signal-to-noise ratio at each retinal location (the “d’ map”) together with the prior map. It can be shown that the Bayes-optimal decision rule is to multiply the response at each location by the d’ at that location, add the log prior for that location, and then pick the location that has the maximum. For a wide range of d’ and prior maps we simulated performance for the optimal and various heuristic decision rules. As expected, varying the d’ and prior maps has a large effect on performance due to the variation in the available sensory information. However, a wide range of simple decision rules perform almost as well as the Bayes-optimal rule. In other words, in the covert search task, our decision processes can be idiosyncratic and almost completely ignorant of the d’ and prior maps and still perform optimally.",NIH grant EY11747,Talk preferred,No,Zhang,Anqi,University of Texas at Austin,,,,,,,,,,No - Submit abstract,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our methodology consists of four stages: In Phase 1, CNN development, we train a VGG model to recognize patient sex from retinal images. Phase 2, Inspiration, involves reviewing post-hoc interpretation tools' visualizations to draw observations and formulate exploratory hypotheses regarding the CNN model's decision process. This yielded 14 testable hypotheses related to potential variances in vasculature and optic disc. In Phase 3, Exploration, we test these hypotheses on an independent dataset, of which nine demonstrated significant differences. In Phase 4, Verification, five out of nine these nine hypotheses are re-tested on a new dataset, verifying five of them: significantly greater length, more nodes and branches of retinal vasculature, a larger area covered by vessels in the superior temporal quadrant, and a darker peri-papillary region in male eyes.

We tested whether exposure to spatially-uniform chromatic or luminance flicker affected detection thresholds for 543 nm increments delivered through an AOSLO. Heterochromatic flicker photometry was used to determine isoluminant settings for the red and green primaries of a DLP display; this isoluminant red-green mixture provided the 2.1° background upon which 23 arcmin (N=4) or 3 arcmin (N=2) stimuli were presented for 100ms. The projector background was modulated to produce isoluminant chromatic flicker or isochromatic luminance flicker at 3.75 or 30 Hz. The time-averaged luminance and chromaticity for all adaptation conditions were equivalent. For each condition, data collection was preceded by 2 minutes of preadaptation, followed by alternating windows of stimulus delivery (1 sec, steady background) and top-up adaptation (3 sec). Thresholds for all flicker conditions were compared to data obtained on a static background. For 23 arcmin spots, we found reduced sensitivity in the 3.75 Hz chromatic and luminance flicker conditions, but no adaptation effect was observed for 3 arcmin flashes or for 30 Hz flicker of either type. Our data suggest that raster-scanned, AO-corrected stimuli are susceptible to flicker adaptation, but that proximity to a flickering edge may be an important factor governing the effects of contrast adaptation on small spot detection.","National Institutes of Health: R01EY023591, T35EY007139-30; Air Force Office of Scientific Research: FA9550-21-1-0230, FA9550-20-1-0195; Hellman Fellows Program; Alcon Research Institute",Talk preferred,Yes (all student / postdoc trainees are eligible),Kuo,Vickie,"Herbert Werthiem School of Optometry and Vision Science, University of California Berkeley",Tuten,William S.,"Herbert Werthiem School of Optometry and Vision Science, University of California Berkeley",,,,,,,No - Submit abstract,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the study of visual neurophysiology in awake primates is complicated by the constant occurrence of eye movements, even during periods of nominal fixation. To address this challenge, we adapted a recently developed high-resolution digital dual-Purkinje-image (dDPI) eye tracker (Wu et al., 2023) for use with macaque monkeys. In addition to tracking the Purkinje images, we simultaneously estimate the pupil center and size: a first for video eye tracking. We then sought to evaluate the efficacy of dDPI eye tracking for studying visual processing in fixating macaques by recording single neurons from the lateral geniculate nucleus while a spatially-correlated noise stimulus was displayed. Our analyses show that, as a result of properly accounting for eye movements post-hoc, the predictive performance of generalized linear models improves and the estimates center radii contract to values equal to or smaller than those reported in the literature. Notably, correcting for eye movements using the locations of the pupil center and corneal reflection—the standard method in video eye tracking—yielded worse model fits and larger receptive field sizes.

In this work we present a new approach for retinal tracking, which is based on imaging small retinal patches (~1.5—3°) using self-repeating Lissajous scanning patterns. Pattern repetition rates close to 4kHz are achieved with an optical design that employs two MEMS microscanners with closely matching resonant frequencies, working in mutually perpendicular dimensions.

It is not known whether perception of visual space is also affected by similar adaptation mechanisms. The current study seeks to elucidate if eccentric gaze holding changes the perception of space in a relative spatial judgment task. To measure their spatial bias, twelve subjects were asked to report which among two short vertical lines flashed to the left or to the right of the display was closer to a third central line. Perception was assessed after holding eccentric gaze at 40 degrees towards the left or right and compared with control trials without eccentric gaze holding. Subjects showed a significant difference in spatial bias between the leftward and rightward gaze holding conditions (p = 0.04), suggesting that the visual space changes differently with respect to the side where gaze was held. While we did not observe an overall bias (p = 0.327) under no gaze holding we did observe a significant correlation between handedness and spatial bias (r2 = 0.4, p = 0.04).

When the retinal image is stationary, Vernier thresholds depend jointly on contrast and duration through contrast energy: squared contrast times duration. Introducing fixational drift eye movements impairs performance, when the information about eye path is not accounted for by the computational observer. When the path of fixational drift is made available and used ideally, there is no noticeable difference with the stationary case. The lack of improvement when the path of fixational drift is known exactly may reflect the high-density of foveal cones relative to the optical point spread function and the fact that we did not introduce temporal filtering by the visual system.

However, it is not clear if this reflects long-term tuning to ocular characteristics, or a more dynamic adjustment to image quality. To test this, fixational eye movements were measured using an AOSLO and stimuli were presented through the imaging system at 30 Hz. Image quality was altered by simulating aberrations. Five participants completed a tumbling E task under three conditions: no aberration, the participant’s natural aberration, and 0.25 D defocus. A 1.2 arcmin gap width E was presented as a 543 nm increment on the 840 nm imaging light for 750 ms. Conditions were randomly interleaved, and feedback was given on each trial. As expected, performance was highest with no aberration, followed by the observer’s natural aberration and was worst for defocus. However, drift characteristics (bivariate contour ellipse area, BCEA, and diffusion constant) did not vary, suggesting that on a trial-to-trial basis drift was not tuned to stimulus quality. To test whether drift might be tuned over time, two participants repeated the experiment in ordered blocks of trials. There were differences in BCEA between ordered and randomised trials, but these were not consistent between participants.

Here, we examine whether American Sign Language (ASL) experience affects divided attention for stimuli: do signers & non-signers differ in their ability to process two signs at once? In a probe recognition paradigm, participants were presented with two letter signs, one or both of which were pre-cued as relevant (single- and dual-task conditions, respectively), and then responded whether a probe sign matched the cued sign(s). The dual-task deficit is the difference in performance between the single- and dual-task conditions and measures the cost of dividing attention. Preliminary data show that hearing non-signers and signers had a similar dual-task deficit (11.8% ± 2.2%, n = 5 vs. 11.4% ± 1.5%, n = 6), with no significant difference between the groups (t(7.27) = 0.18, p = 0.86). The magnitude of these divided attention effects is consistent with processing limits observed for object judgments (e.g. Popovkina, Palmer, Moore, & Boynton, JoV 2021).

We estimated perceptual scales for suprathreshold achromatic square patches. Increments and decrements on the mid-gray background were estimated separately. Observers judged which pair of stimuli were more similar in half of the sessions, and more different in the other half sessions. For most observers, the two tasks produced the same perceptual scales: a decelerating curve for increment contrasts and a cubic curve for decremental contrasts (cf. Whittle, 1992). These scales predicted forced-choice contrast discrimination thresholds for both increments and decrements. However, for a subset of observers, the ‘more different’ judgments produced scales that accelerated with contrast for both increments and decrements; these scale shapes do not predict their discrimination thresholds.

Chromatic pattern onsets produce large and stereotypical waveforms that reliably differ from standard achromatic pattern reversal VEP waveforms used in clinical applications. Rapid contrast adaptation for sustained chromatic but not transient achromatic mechanisms has been suggested as one explanation for these observations. Here we first examined changes in the magnitude of response during recordings to reversing and onset grating patterns that preferentially modulate the L-M, S, and achromatic pathways. Given the evidence for both chromatic and achromatic orientation-selective mechanisms, we then hypothesized that contrast adaptation may be reduced by changing the orientation of the pattern for each reversal or onset. VEPs were recorded for 60 s with 2 onsets/reversals per second using both fixed and alternating (horizontal/vertical) orientations. FFT amplitudes for 6-second windows did not reveal evidence of adaptation for chromatic or achromatic onsets or reversal patterns over the 60-second recording period.

In this study, we report the results of experiments using comparable perceptual contrasts, pattern reversals, and a coextensive and highly-demanding, multiple object tracking (MOT) task. Our findings support prior VEP results indicating that although achromatic VEPs are modulated by attention, chromatic VEPs are more robust to attentional modulation, even for highly demanding distractor tasks. We also found that when compared to a non-attentional condition, the attenuation of the VEP when attending to the MOT task was greater in magnitude than the enhancement of the VEP when attending to the VEP stimulus. This supports prior conclusions, that while avoiding active distraction is likely important, insuring an “attentive state” is not always necessary when recording VEPs.

To gain insight into the suitability of this cue for object recognition, we examined convolutional neural network (CNNs) models that had been trained to recognize objects in natural images. Because CNNs are only trained to do a single task, any properties they possess are likely useful for that task. We focused specifically on units in the second convolutional layer invariant to contrast polarity, a useful trait for object boundary detection. Some of these units were tuned for a nonlinear combination of color and luminance, which is broadly consistent with a role in object boundary detection. Others were tuned for luminance alone, but few were tuned for color alone. A literature review reveals that V1 complex cells have a similar distribution of tuning. We speculate that this pattern of sensitivity provides an efficient basis for object recognition, perhaps by mitigating the effects of lighting on luminance contrast polarity. The paucity of contrast polarity-invariant representation of chromaticity alone suggests that it is redundant with other representations.

Methods: SSVEPs were recorded from 12 subjects using a canonical V1 template (Poncet & Ales, 2023). Eyes were targeted using shutter goggles and stimuli were contrast-reversing gratings or disks at 5Hz (left eye) and 7Hz (right eye). Experimental factors were stimulus SF (disk, grating 1cpd), chromaticity (LMS, L-M or S-cone isolating) and ocularity (left, right or both). Results: Monocular conditions generated large responses at 2F. In binocular conditions, all 2F responses showed suppression, and significant intermodulation (IM) terms (sums and differences of the inputs - e.g., 2Hz) were present. The magnitude of both suppression and IM in the binocular condition depended on SF and chromaticity; IM amplitudes were higher for gratings compared to disks in the luminance condition, but higher for disks compared to gratings in the chromatic conditions.

To understand this effect, we modeled how the temporally low-pass filtering that occurs within each cone is expected to impact visual performance. We simulated a grating (10 cpd Gabor) detection task in which the stimulus was present for two 15 msec frames. We used the ISETBio software to compute cone excitations and cone photocurrent responses to the stimulus, for different contrasts and retinal positions, and used linear SVM classifiers to estimate computational-observer detection thresholds. We examined three retinal-motion conditions: 1) stimulus stabilized on the retina; 2) stimulus shifted 0.5 cycle orthogonal to grating orientation across the two frames; 3) stimulus shifted 1 cycle. Across all three conditions, detection threshold estimated on the basis of cone excitations varied little. Threshold estimated on the basis of photocurrent, however, was highest for the 0.5 cycle shift, and about the same for the no shift and 1 cycle shift conditions. Qualitatively, this result recapitulates the findings of Braun et al. and suggests that those findings may be understood as a consequence of the initial visual encoding.

Although perceptual learning has been shown to be effective in a variety of perceptual tasks, few studies have examined perceptual learning in color perception. In this study, we investigated how color discrimination training at a base color affected various aspects of color perception for entire hues. The training consisted of five days of S color discrimination (300 trials/day) at either the negative or positive L-M base color, depending on the observer groups. Before and after the training, three types of color perception tests (color difference, unique hue, and color category boundary) were conducted for colors with various hues to examine the changes in color perception due to the training. The results showed that the color discrimination thresholds in the training decreased as expected with repeated trials. Interestingly, the training also affected the performance of the three types of tests; the perceived color difference around the training color tended to increase, and some of the unique hues and the color category boundaries shifted significantly toward the training color. These results suggest that only a few days of color discrimination training can spill over to the entire color space and induce distortion of the perceptual color space.",JSPS KAKENHI 21KK0203,Poster only,Yes (all student / postdoc trainees are eligible),Nagai,Takehiro,Tokyo Institute of Technology,,,,,,,,,,No - Submit abstract,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we use sorting to test two hypotheses related to these ideas. 1) If the constrained color sorts (CCSs) depend solely on universal processes that guide color-term evolution, then CCSs should be relatively insensitive to the exact composition of the color palette. 2) Otherwise, CCSs should at least be “optimal” (as measured by well-formedness: Regier et al., 2007). We report three studies, each using a different palette, where English speakers sorted the color samples into 2 … 6 piles; one study also included Somali speakers. All palettes included good examples of the Basic Color Categories (BCCs), but they differed in how hue, saturation, and lightness covaried. Results showed that pile-sorts reflected psychologically salient features of colors, which were mostly linked to BCCs. However, 1) the unfolding of sort-categories with increasing n differed greatly across palettes, and the order in which the sort-categories appeared always deviated from predictions based on classical theories of color term evolution; 2) pile-sorts were not optimal. Taken together, our results reveal strong dependence of CCSs on pre-existing lexical categories but only weak dependence on universal pre-linguistic representations of color related to color-term evolution.",National Science Foundation BCS-1152841 to DTL,No preference,No,Brown,Angela M.,The Ohio State University,,,,,,,,,,No - Submit abstract,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there have been few reports about how quickly our sensitivities of luminance and chromaticity discrimination recover in this situation. This study aimed to quantify the time course of discrimination sensitivity for luminance and chromaticity directions after an abrupt decrease in background luminance. In each trial, the background luminance dropped from 100 cd/m² to 1 cd/m². Then, one target and three reference stimuli with different colors were presented under four stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) conditions. The observer was asked to discriminate the target stimulus from the reference stimuli. The results showed that discrimination sensitivity was lowest right after the background luminance change and gradually improved with SOAs. However, sensitivity recovery differed across color directions, with the most improvement in luminance, followed by S, and negligible change in L-M. There was a statistically significant difference between +S and ±(L-M) sensitivities, indicating that the sensitivity recovery after the sudden background luminance change differed between chromaticity directions.

The aim of this study, was to elucidate how color forms image features that contribute to translucency in psychophysical experiments. The stimuli were computer-graphics images of translucent objects with different spectral scattering coefficients (i.e., hues) and various optical and geometrical parameters. Achromatic images with the same luminance as the chromatic images were also created. Perceived translucency was measured using Thurston’s pairwise comparison, and the effect of chromaticity or translucency was evaluated by comparing translucency in achromatic and chromatic images. The results showed higher perceived translucency for the chromatic object images than the achromatic ones. Subsequently, we analyzed how different image features correlate with the effects of color on translucency using multiple regression analysis. The result indicated that the luminance- chromaticity correlation, which has been proposed as a potential cue for translucency could hardly explain the color effects. Rather, we found that the change in brightness contrast in the diffuse components modulated by the Helmholtz–Kohlrausch (H-K) effect was strongly and negatively correlated with the color effects.

To overcome this gap, cones were spectrally classified using adaptive optics OCT-based optoretinography in human subjects and their variation was described in the macula.  To date, we have classified ~130000 total cones in 9 subjects across 79 regions of interest (ROI), with a maximum of 16 retinal eccentricities per subject spread along the 4 cardinal meridians.  In 2 two subjects, the variation in cone spectral topography in both eyes was compared. The L: M cone ratio decreased in the foveal slope (0.4°- 1°) but remained relatively uniform in the parafovea from 1.5°- 10° eccentricity. The % S-cones and S-cone density were consistent with prior histology (Curcio et al. 1991). No significant differences were observed in the fellow eyes of the same subject or the distribution of cone types across the 4 cardinal meridians. Decreased L: M cone ratio in the foveal slope suggests earlier differentiation of M-cones than L-cones. The stable L: M  cone ratio in the parafovea suggests that the greater fall off in chromatic versus achromatic vision with eccentricity is not explained by cone spectral composition, but is rather attributed to pooling in downstream neurons.

In humans S-cones have been reported as randomly arranged within 2° eccentricity and semi-regular more peripherally. A model describing how S-cone regularity varies across the retina is yet to be formulated. Here we describe such a model, dependent on 2 parameters - the average distance between neighboring cones and the proportion of S-cones - that is sufficient to explain S-cone regularity across the central retina. Cones were classified using AO-OCT optoretinography in ROIs distributed across the 4 cardinal meridians in 2 subjects (12 ROIs each) between 1.3 - 12.9°eccentricity. The radius of the S-exclusion zone, the area surrounding S-cones where other S-cones are significantly unlikely to appear, was found to be about twice the average distance between neighboring cones in 19/24 mosaics. We found that the measured regularity of S-cone mosaics increases linearly with the increasing proportion of S cones with eccentricity. Using the average distance between neighboring cones and proportion of S-cones per ROI as variables, we created a model to simulate S-cone mosaics that agree well with the observed topography. These results benefit our understanding of the foundational patterns underpinning spectral topography, and the ability to accurately simulate S-cone topography in computational models of early vision.

The Opn1mw knockout was reported as having “greatly reduced” M opsin expression, while the Opn1sw knockout was a severely hypomorphic allele. Their double opsin gene knockout (DKO) mouse is not a good model of BCM, which is typically a stationary disorder with no cone degeneration. We evaluated Opn1mw Opn1sw DKO mice for cone degeneration; these mice were created by Regeneron by deleting both genes using genome editing. Eyes of 1 year old DKO animals were processed for cryosections. Sections were immunostained using antibodies against a variety of cone proteins (S and M opsins, arrestin) and markers for retinal degeneration, then confocal imaged. Despite the absence of both cone opsins, cones remain viable and morphologically normal, and the retina shows no signs of degeneration at 1 year.

The study parameterized severity of color deficiency, the wavelength shift of cone spectral fundamentals, and the spectral distribution of display primaries. The first parameter was derived by computing the confusion index of the CDO, employing a modified version of the FM-100 test (ZJU50Hue). The second parameter was determined via evaluation of a wavelength-shifted ZJU50Hue test on color-normal observers (CNO). The three parameters were used to model the gamut mapping between CNO and CDO. In this study, extended reality (XR) based modules were developed to acquire these parameters and consequently tailor the headset display to assist CDOs. We chose to implement the Cambridge color test over the ZJU50Hue test as threshold results along the protan, deutan, and tritan lines are more informative than a single confusion index. Preliminary results on a calibrated Varjo XR-3 headset suggest a high correlation between the standard CCT and our XR-based trivector test.

Traditional subjective methods like visual acuity and visual fields, and objective ones like electroretinography, have limitations. An ideal complement to these techniques is optoretinography (ORG), which images the retina and tests its function at once. ORG utilizes the phase of the optical coherence tomography (OCT) signal to quantify nanometer-scale changes, measuring subtle photoreceptor responses to stimuli. Efforts to observe stimulus-evoked responses in human cone photoreceptors began with adaptive optics (AO) and common path interferometry, enabling the resolution and tracking of individual cells. Advances in OCT systems with cellular resolution through AO or digital aberration correction successfully measured ORG responses from single cones and rods. This method tracks phase differences between outer segment tips (COST or ROST) and the inner-outer segment junction (IS/OS) to assess individual cell responses.

We evaluate the directionality appearance of the photoreceptors, and its relation to drusen appearance in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The refractive index contrast of the mitochondria collectively resembles that of micron-sized reflectors. Obliqueness of the scattering results in vignetting by the pupil that impacts on the brightness of the photoreceptors. Our hypothesis is that in early-stage AMD, drusen will perturb the photoreceptor alignment and thus cause oblique scattering and reduced brightness on the slope of the drusen in high-resolution retinal images. We model how this affects the observable photoreceptor mosaic both in the healthy eye and in eyes with AMD. The results confirm that the annular dark ring around drusen is likely caused by oblique scattering.

We determined the ability of Firsocostat to increase fatty acid oxidation and to decrease lipid contents in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) differentiated into RPE.

If sufficiently many cones of a single type (L, M, or S) could be tracked and stimulated, then an observer would see what may be termed a pure impossible color.  If this could be done simultaneously for all three cone types, then an observer would see an arbitrary color, either possible or impossible, i.e., an arbitrary point in the convex hull of the pure impossible colors.   Some, but not all, of the usual chromaticity diagrams can be extended to include all impossible colors for the CIE 2-degree standard observer.  I will show which chromaticity diagrams can be so extended and what these extended chromaticity diagrams look like.",,Talk preferred,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,No - Submit abstract,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is normally interpreted as a color constancy illusion or shadow illusion similar to the checkerboard brightness illusion. However, subsequent research on brown induction suggests this change is primarily driven by local surround elements that only influence low S-cone activity targets (primarily, yellowish). Using a similar stimulus we have gathered data on the relative contribution of the various elements of this illusion and show that unlike the checkerboard illusion, shadow inducing elements are unneeded to induce the red/green shift seen in the brown induction and instead act as moderating variables on the induction effect from the immediate surround. However, similar to the checkerboard illusion, the other elements have a very strong effect on brightness induction, and the use of achromatic (gray) stimuli causes little brightness induction from the immediate surround when the shadow inducing elements are removed. Furthermore, placement of brown stimuli on the checkerboard illusion produces a relatively weak induction, unlike what is seen for achromatic stimuli. This is further evidence of the independence of red/green induction effects from brown's status as a dark contrast color.",,No preference,No,Shinomori,Keizo,Kochi University of Technology,,,,,,,,,,No - Submit abstract,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
