			<abstract>
				<p>Introduction: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory disease (IMID) of the central nervous system (CNS). Early identification of MS, especially as a screening method for at-risk individuals, is crucial to delay disease progression and improve patient outcomes by preventing future irreversible neurologic damage. In this work, we utilize well-validated tracking scanning laser ophthalmoscope (TSLO) image to predict MS compared to the unaffected controls. While traditional Machine Learning (ML) methods, such as Logistic Regression (LR), have demonstrated a strong predictive power [Mauro F. Pinto et al., 2020] in disease identification, we propose the use of a novel DL based model. Though the use of Deep Neural Network (DNN), this model can have a much higher learning capacity to capture latent features embedded in the retinal images. We hypothesize that such latent information, often hidden in ML feature engineering processes, plays an important role for the prediction of disease and can be well represented by DL models. Objectives: To establish a DL based model capable of learning latent image features to provide predictive power for the presence of MS. Aims: Utilize a deep convolutional neural network to extract the retinal coding and implement a recurrent neural network to learn the temporal correlations in video sequences. Methods: Our approaches were tested using a 250-subject MS/control database collected at the UCSF. Patients with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)&lt; 4 are compared to healthy subjects. Both raw retinal images and the frequency and spatial patterns of the eye motion are combined to construct a hybrid image, denoted as “retinal coding”, and directly fed to the DL model for training and testing. Results: Preliminary results on predictive power were measured using Area-under-Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve, sensitivity, and specificity, as well as an F-1 score. We observe an AUC of 0.920, sensitivity of 0.90, specificity of 0.89 and F-1 score of 0.89 using the DL model to distinguish MS from controls, which outperforms the baseline LR model by 24%. Conclusions: This work can be considered as a proof-of-concept concerning the possibility of identifying MS disease using a DL based approach. The results demonstrate the possibility of predicting early-stage MS and understanding disease’s dynamics. Such end-to-end model could be generalizable and trained on other disease states.</p>
