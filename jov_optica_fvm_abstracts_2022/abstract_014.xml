			<abstract>
				<p>The COVD pandemic has seen a further rise in the prevalence of myopia world-wide, adding to the urgency of effective treatments that can prevent or slow myopia progression. In addition to multifocal soft contact lenses and orthokeratology lenses for myopia control, a variety of novel spectacle lenses involving modified peripheries are either currently under clinical trial or recently approved. Yet still unresolved questions related to underlying retinal mechanisms of action represent handicaps to their further refinement and improved efficacy. In this presentation, results will be presented from studies using young chicks as a model for manipulating the amount, retinal location and timing of imposed optical defocus, as well as the spatial frequency content of retinal images (with Bangerter foils), by way of offering some additional insights into mechanisms. The predictive values of choroidal thickness changes, as well as eye shape changes, as determinants of “myopia control”, will also be considered.</p>
