			<abstract>
				<p>The magnocellular (M) visual pathway can be distinguished from its finer-grained parvocellular (P) counterpart by its stronger response gain to contrasts near human detection threshold. This distinction is found when stimulus size is matched to the relatively large receptive field size of M cells, but it is less clear if preserved at smaller spatial scales. We examined foveal detection thresholds in tandem with a masking paradigm known to desensitize the M pathway. We used a custom DLP display in Maxwellian view to present either 3 or 23 arcmin spots for 100 ms against a uniform gray disk (1Â° VA) surrounded by a 0.5 cpd, 100% contrast, square wave grating flickered at 7 frequencies ranging from 0 to 30 Hz. Detection data were fit with psychometric functions to estimate threshold and thresholds were normalized to the static (0 Hz) condition. Relative sensitivity was fit with a modified impulse response function and compared to a constant model with ANOVA. With masking we found a significant reduction in sensitivity for large (23arcmin) increments (mean=0.39 log units; n=4; p&lt;0.01) and decrements (0.31 log units; n=4; p=0.02)at 8.3Hz. By contrast, no significant masking effect was observed for small spot increments or decrements (p&gt;0.05). These data suggest that the M pathway is not the primary determinant of small spot thresholds under the conditions studied. Further investigation with adaptive optics may be necessary to fully elaborate single-cone processing in the fovea.</p>
